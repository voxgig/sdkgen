# Secret access via a vendored voxgig_sekreto provider chain, and the
# access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. A port of the ts
# reference (tm/ts/src/feature/secrets/SecretsFeature.ts) - semantics
# must match, seam for seam.
#
# The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
# credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
# rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
# sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
# provider - a `memory` store named 'options' - so an explicit value
# always wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case
# logic. When the option is unset, the remaining providers (env, dotenv, a
# vault) are asked in order, and moving a credential from code to a vault
# becomes a configuration change.
#
# SOME APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What the chain
# resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived ACCESS token
# from a token endpoint; the access token is what every request carries,
# and it expires. `exchange.active` turns that round trip on: the resolved
# secret is POSTed to `exchange.path` (relative to options.base), the
# access token from the response is written to options.apikey, and a
# response in `exchange.statuses` (401) buys another and retries once.
#
# That last part is why this feature wraps the transport. Expiry is only
# ever discovered from a RESPONSE, and the transport is the one place a
# response can be seen before the operation pipeline turns it into a
# result. With the exchange off, nothing is wrapped.
#
# WHERE ts RESOLVES ASYNCHRONOUSLY, PYTHON IS SYNC THROUGHOUT: sekreto's
# python port does blocking IO, so the PreSpec hook resolves in place and
# ts's shared in-flight promise degenerates to the resolved/cache flags
# below. The observable rules are unchanged: one resolution serves every
# op while caching is on, `cache: False` asks the chain again each time,
# and a provider ERROR raises and fails the op - sekreto's miss-vs-error
# rule: never fall through to an unauthenticated request because a store
# was broken. prepare_auth itself is untouched: PreSpec runs before
# make_spec on every entity op, so the resolved value lands in the live
# options where prepare_auth already looks.
