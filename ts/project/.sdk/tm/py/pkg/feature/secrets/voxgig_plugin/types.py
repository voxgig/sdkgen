"""Shared types. Deliberately small: the design's section 19 budget says
the library owns naming, configuration, lifecycle, ordering, binding and
teardown, and nothing else.

PYTHON IS THE OTHER HALF OF P4'S PROVING PAIR (section 18): "the closest
dynamic analogue that is not JavaScript". It raises where the canonical
raises and go returns, so the interesting differences here are not about
errors — they are about the places JavaScript's coercion rules and
Python's disagree, and `True == 1` is the first of them.
