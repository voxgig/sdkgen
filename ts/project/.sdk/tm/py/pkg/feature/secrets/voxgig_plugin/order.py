"""Ordering (section 7) - one rule, one place.

sdkgen grew two special cases in `makeOptions` (`test`, then `station`)
and the third was not far off. This sort is the whole replacement, and the
tiers are in this order for a reason:

  1 constraints   before/after edges, by ref or by name
  2 bands         integer, lower first, default 0
  3 declaration   ties break by `pos`

CONSTRAINTS BEAT BANDS precisely so the correct tool wins when both are
present. A band expresses a genuine cross-cutting layer; a constraint
expresses a relationship between two specific things; and a band chosen by
trial and error to fix an ordering bug is a bug wearing a number.

    architecture, which is a different kind of claim and must not lose a
    tie to a document.

    So a pin PLACES the binding at the named end, and an ordering that
    would move it away is `plugin_order_pinned` - rejected, not honoured
    into a broken wrap. Station's transport adapter must sit immediately
    outside the base transport; an `order` list that moves it has to be an
