"""Whole-graph resolution (section 11.4) - a phase, not a discovery.

"Activate, and wait in `pending` if you must" is correct and, on its own,
produces a terrible experience: apply twenty instances against a registry
missing one thing and you get NINETEEN pending rows and no statement of
what is actually wrong.

`resolve_graph` is a PURE FUNCTION of the registry and the intended
activation set. No callbacks run, no state changes, nothing is touched. It
answers for the whole graph at once which instances can be live, and for
each blocked one THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT that is unmet, and why.

The failure mode being designed against is a famous one: OSGi's resolver
is correct and its diagnostics are legendarily unusable. A resolver that
says "blocked" without saying WHY has moved the problem rather than solved
it, so `why` is part of the contract and the corpus pins its shape.
