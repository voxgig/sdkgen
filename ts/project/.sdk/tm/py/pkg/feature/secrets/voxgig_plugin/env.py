"""Environment overrides (section 9.5) - level 7 of the ladder.

One prefix, so nothing drifts: `VOXGIG_PLUGIN_*`.

  VOXGIG_PLUGIN_PROFILE            the profile name
  VOXGIG_PLUGIN_<REF>_<PATH>       one option
  VOXGIG_PLUGIN_ACTIVE/INACTIVE    comma-separated refs, INACTIVE wins

THE ENCODING IS LOSSY, AND THIS SAYS SO RATHER THAN PRETENDING OTHERWISE.
Ref and path are upper-snake with `$` -> `__` and `.` -> `_`. But `_` is
legal in a name and in a tag, and the mapping folds case, so `retry$fast`
and `retry__fast` both encode to `RETRY__FAST`, as do `Retry$fast` and
`retry$Fast`.

Rather than restrict a grammar the rest of the stack already uses, the
host DETECTS THE COLLISION: it encodes every ref it holds, and a key two
refs claim is `plugin_env_ambiguous`, naming both. The affected pair stays
configurable by document and by API, just not by environment - which is
the honest trade.

Pure: a function over a string map and a ref set. The corpus tests it
without touching a real environment.
