"""Dependency cardinality, policy, and the restart graph (section 11.3).

TWO AXES, BOTH DECLARED BY THE DEFINITION THAT HAS THE REQUIREMENT,
because only it knows what it can cope with:

               | static (default)          | dynamic
  -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
  mandatory    | unmet -> pending;         | unmet -> pending;
  (default)    | lost  -> pending,         | lost  -> STAYS LIVE,
               |          recursively      |          notified
  -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
  optional:true| never gates activation;   | never gates activation;
               | a change deactivates and  | a change is a
               | reactivates               | notification, nothing else

`dynamic` means the plugin has said, IN WRITING, that it can survive its
provider being swapped underneath it. It is not the default because most
plugins cannot, and the cost of wrongly assuming they can is a live
instance holding a dead reference.

The rebinding-preference axis is deliberately omitted. OSGi has reluctant
vs greedy and it is a knob every author must understand to read anyone
else's component; we take always-reluctant. Three axes were more than the
model can carry across twenty ports.

    every requirement. The per-requirement form is the one section 11.1's
    object syntax exists for, and it is strictly more expressive: an
    instance that is `static` on its store and `dynamic` on its metrics
    cannot be written at all at the instance level, and that is the
    ordinary case rather than an exotic one.

    `optional` unions rather than overriding - both spellings are
    statements that this requirement need not gate activation, and there
    is no reading under which one of them means "actually, mandatory".

    consumer - and a cycle of restarts does not settle: A comes up, B
    restarts, which changes B's capability, which restarts A,
    indefinitely.

    ONLY `dynamic` OPTIONAL EDGES ARE EXCLUDED, and they are the ones the
    exclusion was for: two plugins that optionally and dynamically consume
    each other's capabilities both activate happily, neither gates on the
    other, and each is merely notified when the other appears. Nothing
    restarts, so nothing oscillates.
