"""Extension points (section 6). Three kinds, chosen because they are what
the two existing systems actually needed, and no more.

A PLUGIN NEVER MUTATES THE HOST. That inversion is what makes deactivation
possible: sdkgen's `utility.fetcher = wrapped` is not undoable, but "this
instance holds slot 3 of the request chain" is undoable in O(1). OSGi named
it the whiteboard pattern in 2004, in a paper called *Listeners Considered
Harmful*, and for exactly this reason.
