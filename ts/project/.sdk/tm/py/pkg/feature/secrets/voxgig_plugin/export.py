"""Exports (section 11).

An instance publishes values for other plugins and for the application.
Read with `host.exports('retry$fast/client')`.

THE UNQUALIFIED ALIAS IS THE INTERESTING PART. `retry/client` resolves to
the UNTAGGED instance if one exists; if not, and exactly one tagged
instance exports that key, it resolves to that one; if two do, it is
`plugin_export_ambiguous` - deliberately diverging from seneca's silent
last-wins, because with multi-instance as a headline feature an ambiguous
alias is a defect waiting for production.
