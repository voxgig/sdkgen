"""The host: the lifecycle state machine (section 5), extension points
(section 6), and resource capture (section 8).

TWO RULES SHAPE EVERY METHOD BELOW.

Transitions are SEQUENTIAL (section 5.2). One at a time, in call order,
never interleaved; a transition triggered from inside a lifecycle callback
is `plugin_reentrant`. A hard rule, because it is the only way the
semantics can be identical in Go, in Ruby and in single-threaded
JavaScript.

Reconciliation is EAGER (section 18's portability budget). A transition
settles by running the state machine to a fixed point, not by suspending
on a promise. Every port must be able to do the same, and fourteen of them
will not have JavaScript's event loop.
