"""Capabilities (section 11.1).

A DEPENDENCY IS ON A CAPABILITY, NOT ON A REF - because it is a dependency
on something that can do the job, and which instance is doing it is
exactly the configuration detail a plugin must not care about.

But A BINDING IS TO AN INSTANCE, not to a capability, which is what
decides behaviour when the bound provider leaves while another match
remains.

    highest `version`, then LOWEST `priority` (default 0), then

    `priority` is a field on the capability rather than section 7's
    `order` band, because bands live on POINT BINDINGS: a provider may
    have several bindings with different bands, or none at all, so a rank
    reaching for one would be undefined in the common case.

    Without a total rank, "any provider satisfies" is true of the GRAPH
    and useless to the PLUGIN - two ports could bind different `store`
    instances, both resolve green, and behave differently, which is
    precisely the divergence a shared corpus exists to catch.
