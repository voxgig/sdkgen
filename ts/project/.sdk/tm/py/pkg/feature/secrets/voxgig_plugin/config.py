"""The declarative document (section 9): normalization, and the ten-level
precedence ladder.

TWO FUNCTIONS, AND THE SPLIT BETWEEN THEM IS FORCED.

`normalize_config` normalizes STRUCTURE and ENTRY KEYS. It does not merge
options, and cannot: section 9.4 makes merge behaviour a property of the
definition's option SHAPE, which normalization has never seen. A
normalizer that flattened the option layers would make `$MERGE: append`
unimplementable at load time, because the layers it must concatenate would
already be collapsed.

`resolve_options` applies the ladder, and it is the only place that knows
the shape.
