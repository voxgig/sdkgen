# Cost tracking and spend budget. Uses BOTH seams, which is the point of the
# feature: money is spent per HTTP ATTEMPT (a retried call is charged again,
# because the upstream API charges it again), but it is owed by an
# OPERATION. So the transport wrap prices each attempt, and PreDone
# attributes the running total to `<entity>.<op>` and to the caller
# (`ctrl.actor`, the same actor the audit feature records).
#
# The price of an attempt comes from the first source that answers: a
# response header (`header` x `perUnit`), the rate table (`rates`, keyed
# `<entity>.<op>` / `<op>` / `*`), then the flat `unit`. A body figure
# (`path` x `perUnit`, e.g. "usage.total_tokens") is read at PreDone
# instead, from the already-parsed result, and describes the whole call, so
# it REPLACES the per-attempt estimate rather than adding to it.
#
# `budget` caps total spend. With `onBudget: "deny"` a further operation is
# refused at PrePoint, before an endpoint is resolved and before anything
# reaches the network.
#
# ORDER MATTERS. Cost must sit INSIDE the cache, or a response served from
# cache is charged for money that was never spent. The default (map) order
# puts cache innermost and cost outside it, so activate them in list form
# with cost first.
