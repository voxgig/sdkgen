/* The host: the lifecycle state machine (§5), extension points (§6),
 * and resource capture (§8).
 *
 * TWO RULES SHAPE EVERY METHOD BELOW.
 *
 * Transitions are SEQUENTIAL (§5.2). One at a time, in call order,
 * never interleaved; a transition triggered from inside a lifecycle
 * callback is `plugin_reentrant`. A hard rule, because it is the only
 * way the semantics can be identical in Go, in Ruby and in
 * single-threaded JavaScript.
 *
 * Reconciliation is EAGER (§18's portability budget). A transition
 * settles by running the state machine to a fixed point, not by
 * suspending on a promise. Every port must be able to do the same, and
 * fourteen of them will not have JavaScript's event loop. */

   * THE BOUNDARY IS BY METHOD, NOT BY CALLER, and that is a real limit
   * rather than an oversight. No language here can tell the embedding
   * host from a plugin holding the same host object — and a plugin that
   * holds it can already call `close()`. What reservation protects is
   * CONFIGURATION: documents, profile overlays, `VOXGIG_PLUGIN_*`,
   * construction options and ordinary `declare`/`load`/`options` calls.
   * That is what §9.1 lists, and all of it still goes through the
   * check. */
