/* Dependency cardinality, policy, and the restart graph (§11.3).
 *
 * TWO AXES, BOTH DECLARED BY THE DEFINITION THAT HAS THE REQUIREMENT,
 * because only it knows what it can cope with:
 *
 *                | static (default)          | dynamic
 *   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
 *   mandatory    | unmet -> pending;         | unmet -> pending;
 *   (default)    | lost  -> pending,         | lost  -> STAYS LIVE,
 *                |          recursively      |          notified
 *   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
 *   optional:true| never gates activation;   | never gates activation;
 *                | a change deactivates and  | a change is a
 *                | reactivates               | notification, nothing else
 *
 * `dynamic` means the plugin has said, IN WRITING, that it can survive
 * its provider being swapped underneath it. It is not the default
 * because most plugins cannot, and the cost of wrongly assuming they
 * can is a live instance holding a dead reference.
 *
 * The rebinding-preference axis is deliberately omitted. OSGi has
 * reluctant vs greedy and it is a knob every author must understand to
 * read anyone else's component; we take always-reluctant. Three axes
 * were more than the model can carry across twenty ports. */

 *
 * The instance-level `policy` and `optional` list are how a DOCUMENT
 * states the axis without editing the definition, and they apply to
 * every requirement. The per-requirement form is the one §11.1's object
 * syntax exists for, and it is strictly more expressive: an instance
 * that is `static` on its store and `dynamic` on its metrics cannot be
 * written at all at the instance level, and that is the ordinary case
 * rather than an exotic one.
 *
 * `optional` unions rather than overriding — both spellings are
 * statements that this requirement need not gate activation, and there
 * is no reading under which one of them means "actually, mandatory". */

 * consumer — and a cycle of restarts does not settle: A comes up, B
 * restarts, which changes B's capability, which restarts A,
 * indefinitely.
 *
 * ONLY `dynamic` OPTIONAL EDGES ARE EXCLUDED, and they are the ones the
 * exclusion was for: two plugins that optionally and dynamically
 * consume each other's capabilities both activate happily, neither
 * gates on the other, and each is merely notified when the other
 * appears. Nothing restarts, so nothing oscillates.

 * consumer to EVERY node that provides what it needs, because any of
