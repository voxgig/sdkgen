 * and station's per-feature `order` has carried string lists since Stage 3b.

 * SILENTLY DROPPED - the sort came out exactly as if no constraint had been

 * `null` here, and `config/normorder#null-survives` pins that. Typing it
 * as `OrderRef | undefined` told callers a runtime null was impossible
 * while `Config.ts` assigned one straight through `any`. `declared()` is
 * the gate that turns a spec into a constraint; nothing else may assume
