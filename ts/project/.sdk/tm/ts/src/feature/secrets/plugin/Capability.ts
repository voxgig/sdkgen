/* Capabilities (§11.1).
 *
 * A DEPENDENCY IS ON A CAPABILITY, NOT ON A REF — because it is a
 * dependency on something that can do the job, and which instance is
 * doing it is exactly the configuration detail a plugin must not care
 * about.
 *
 * But A BINDING IS TO AN INSTANCE, not to a capability, which is what
 * decides behaviour when the bound provider leaves while another match
 * remains. */

 * band, because bands live on POINT BINDINGS: a provider may have
 * several bindings with different bands, or none at all, so a rank
 * reaching for one would be undefined in the common case.
 *
 * Without a total rank, "any provider satisfies" is true of the GRAPH
 * and useless to the PLUGIN — two ports could bind different `store`
 * instances, both resolve green, and behave differently, which is
 * precisely the divergence a shared corpus exists to catch. */

/** PARTIAL MATCH, RECURSING INTO MAPS (§11.1).
 *
 * §11.1 defines `match` as "a partial match against `attrs`, with
 * exactly the semantics voxgig/struct and the omni corpus already
 * define for `match` — every leaf in the requirement must be present
 * and equal in the capability, keys not mentioned are not checked."
 *
 * THIS FUNCTION IS WHAT "EVERY LEAF" MEANS, and an earlier draft did
 * not have it: the check was `attrs[k] !== req.match[k]`, which for any
 * compound value is JavaScript REFERENCE IDENTITY. A requirement and a
 * capability are declared in different places and are never the same
 * object, so `match: {limits: {max: 5}}` could not be satisfied by any
 * provider at all — including one declaring exactly that. The flat
 * reading is invisible while every corpus entry is scalar, which is why
 * the go port found it and P2 did not.
 *
 * A LIST IS COMPARED LEAF-WISE AT THE SAME LENGTH, not as a subset.
 * "the first two of your three regions" is not something `match` can
 * say, and inventing a spelling for it would be inventing the filter
 * language §11.1 explicitly declines to add. */
