/* The sdkgen bridge (§17.2, P3 item 2).
 *
 * THE DELIVERABLE IS A BRIDGE THAT RUNS AN UNMODIFIED SDKGEN FEATURE
 * CLASS AS A PLUGIN, proving the two vocabularies map — and leaving
 * whether sdkgen's generated code adopts the model as a separate,
 * sdkgen-side decision with its own cost across 23 template trees.
 *
 * A generated SDK is not natively a host. Wrapping one in `inst.host()`
 * directly would be a host-shaped object around a non-host, so the
 * INNER HOST IS THE BRIDGE, NOT THE SDK: it declares points for the
 * SDK's hook vocabulary and its `request` chain, and a feature's own
 * method names become its bindings.
 *
 * WHAT THE BRIDGE BUYS, IN ONE SENTENCE: sdkgen can activate a feature
 * and cannot deactivate one, because its transport wrap is an
 * irreversible assignment — `ctx.utility.fetcher = wrapped` — and its
 * hook methods are read off a fixed array. Both become bindings here,
 * and bindings come out.
 *
 *
 * THIS FILE IS OUTSIDE THE PORTABILITY BUDGET, DELIBERATELY, AND IT IS
 * THE ONLY ONE.
 *
 * `typescript/AGENTS.md` forbids dynamic property interception, and the
 * `utility.fetcher` getter/setter below is exactly that. The budget
 * governs the PORTABLE LIBRARY — the thing twenty languages implement
 * from one corpus — and it is not negotiable there.
 *
 * A BRIDGE TO SDKGEN CANNOT BE PORTED AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE. sdkgen
 * generates SDKs in 23 languages, each feature written in that
 * language's idiom; a Go SDK's feature does not assign
 * `ctx.utility.fetcher`, so there is nothing for a Go translation of
 * this file to intercept. Each language that wants the bridge writes
 * its own, against its own generated code, and the thing they share is
 * the plugin model underneath — not this mechanism.
 *
 * Said here because the contradiction is otherwise live and invisible:
 * `Config.ts` cites the same budget as the reason `apply` refills an
 * options map instead of installing a getter. That reasoning is correct
 * and unchanged; this file is a different kind of thing. */

 *
 *  - `name` and `version` come off the instance, as today;
 *  - `init(ctx, options)` runs in `define`, where reading options and
 *    declaring bindings belong;
 *  - a method named after a hook point IS a binding to that point —
 *    "a feature's method names are its bindings";
 *  - a method named after a replacement seam is a `provider` binding;
 *  - an assignment to `ctx.utility.fetcher` becomes a `request` chain
 *    binding rather than an irreversible overwrite.
 *
 * The feature class is not modified, subclassed or inspected beyond its
 * own public surface. That is the claim being proved.
 *
 *
 * WHAT "AND DEACTIVATES IT" CLAIMS, EXACTLY.
 *
 * §17.2 says `init` "splits into `define` (read options, declare
 * bindings) and `activate` (capture)". THAT SPLIT IS SDKGEN'S TO MAKE.
 * An unmodified feature has one `init` and no teardown method, so the
 * bridge runs `init` in `define` and there is nothing it could call to
 * undo a side effect `init` performed — a connection opened there stays
 * open, and no amount of bridging changes that.
 *
 * So the claim is precisely: THE FEATURE'S BINDINGS BECOME REVERSIBLE.
 * Its hooks stop firing and its transport wrap leaves the chain, with
 * no cooperation from the feature — which is the thing sdkgen cannot do
 * at all, because it assigns the slot and has nowhere to put the old
 * value back. It is not a claim that arbitrary `init` side effects are
 * undone.
 *
 * A feature that DOES carry `activate` / `deactivate` / `close` methods
 * gets them wired below, which is the same mapping applied to the
 * methods §17.2 expects an adopting sdkgen to add. */
