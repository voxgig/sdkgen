/* Whole-graph resolution (§11.4) — a phase, not a discovery.
 *
 * "Activate, and wait in `pending` if you must" is correct and, on its
 * own, produces a terrible experience: apply twenty instances against a
 * registry missing one thing and you get NINETEEN pending rows and no
 * statement of what is actually wrong.
 *
 * `resolvegraph` is a PURE FUNCTION of the registry and the intended
 * activation set. No callbacks run, no state changes, nothing is
 * touched. It answers for the whole graph at once which instances can be
 * live, and for each blocked one THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT that is
 * unmet, and why.
 *
 * The failure mode being designed against is a famous one: OSGi's
 * resolver is correct and its diagnostics are legendarily unusable. A
 * resolver that says "blocked" without saying WHY has moved the problem
 * rather than solved it, so `why` is part of the contract and the
 * corpus pins its shape. */
