// plugin groups IS the SDK's provider vocabulary.
import { FEATURE_PLUGINS } from '../../Config'


// Secret access via a vendored @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the
// access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it.
//
// The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
// credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
// rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
// sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
// provider — a `memory` store named `options` — so an explicit value always
// wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
// When the option is unset, the remaining providers (env, dotenv, a vault)
// are asked in order, and moving a credential from code to a vault becomes
// a configuration change.
//
// SOME APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What the chain
// resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived ACCESS token
// from a token endpoint; the access token is what every request carries,
// and it expires. `exchange.active` turns that round trip on: the resolved
// secret is POSTed to `exchange.path` (relative to options.base), the
// access token from the response is written to options.apikey, and a
// response in `exchange.statuses` (401) buys another and retries once.
//
// That last part is why this feature wraps the transport. Expiry is only
// ever discovered from a RESPONSE, and the transport is the one place a
// response can be seen before the operation pipeline turns it into a
// result. With the exchange off, nothing is wrapped.
//
// Resolution is ASYNC (providers may do IO), but the auth header is built
// by the synchronous prepareAuth inside makeSpec. The bridge is the
// feature hook pipeline: every entity op awaits featureHook('PreSpec')
// before calling makeSpec, so the PreSpec hook below resolves the secret
// once and writes it into the live options where prepareAuth already
// looks. prepareAuth itself is untouched. SolardemoSDK.prepare() bypasses
// feature hooks entirely, so it awaits client._secrets.resolve() itself.
