-- ProjectName SDK corpus test runner: vendored @voxgig/omni driven through
-- its NATIVE API (`makeRunner(specref, provider)`), presented to the corpus
-- tests in the struct-runner shape they already use (`R.spec`, `R.runset`,
-- `R.runsetflags`, `R.client`). No compat shim is vendored: the adapter
-- below IS the whole bridge, per language, per the vendor-tag rollout
-- (docs/design/vendor-tag-rollout.md, Decision 4). It is the lua peer of
-- tm/ts/test/omni.ts / tm/py/test/omni.py, and a port of upstream omni's
-- own lua struct shim (voxgig/omni lua/compat/struct.lua) onto the REAL
-- generated SDK.
--
-- Four local decisions, all required:
--
-- 1. SPEC PATH. omni's own spec loading expects a usable path. A relative
--    path is absolutized against THIS module's directory (test/), so the
--    existing '../../.sdk/test/test.json' constant keeps working verbatim
--    wherever the suite is run from.
--
-- 2. PROVIDER DELEGATION. Corpus-driven contexts get `ctx.client` set to
--    the runner's provider (omni overwrites it on any ctx/args map entry).
--    A five-hook provider object HIDES the live SDK from the generated
--    utilities that reach through it - prepare_auth and prepare_headers via
--    `ctx.client:options_map()`, feature_add appending to client.features.
--    So the provider here is a READ-THROUGH view of the live SDK instance:
--    a table holding the omni hooks whose metatable delegates reads to the
--    SDK (`__index`) and routes writes onto it (`__newindex`) - the lua
--    spelling of ts's prototype delegation. (Upstream omni#56 tracks
--    giving the stock provider the same shape.)
--
-- 3. TWO VALUE MODELS, converted at the subject boundary. omni marks maps
--    and lists by METATABLE IDENTITY and models null/absent as sentinel
--    tables (a lua table cannot hold nil); the SDK and the vendored struct
--    speak dkjson's `__jsontype` convention with plain lua nil. Neither
--    recognises the other, so `wrapsubject` converts every argument on the
--    way in (tostruct) and the result on the way out (toomni), splicing
--    argument mutations back where omni's `match` can see them. This is
--    the port of upstream's compat shim, with ONE deliberate change: a
--    table that belongs to neither model (a live SDK object - the
--    provider, a Context, the utility) passes through BY REFERENCE as a
--    leaf, so subjects keep real object identity through `ctx.client`.
--
-- 4. NO-VALUE ARITY (the zero-argument correction six upstream compat
--    shims carry). An entry with no `in`/`args`/`ctx` must reach the
--    subject as NO value, not as one null. omni models absence as an
--    explicit ABSENT sentinel; the vendored struct's own NOVAL sentinel
--    (upstream struct/lua 0.1.1) is what an absent argument becomes, so
--    `typify()` answers T_noval where `typify(nil)` answers T_null. A
--    port without NOVAL gets trailing absent arguments TRIMMED instead,
--    which `select('#', ...)` reads as a zero-arity call.
--
-- THE VENDORED LUA PORT AND THE omni#54 RUNNER FIXES, checked per the
-- rollout: lua's `match` already reads its base directly (no clone), its
-- `errmessage` already keeps a message-bearing table's message (the SDK's
-- error type answers through __tostring), and its walkers recurse only
-- into omni-marked tables, so live cyclic objects are leaves to them. No
-- resolver workaround is needed at this tag; decision 3's leaf rule is
-- what keeps it that way.
