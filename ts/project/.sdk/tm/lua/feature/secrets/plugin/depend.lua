-- Dependency cardinality, policy, and the restart graph (section 11.3).
--
-- TWO AXES, BOTH DECLARED BY THE DEFINITION THAT HAS THE REQUIREMENT,
-- because only it knows what it can cope with:
--
--                | static (default)          | dynamic
--   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
--   mandatory    | unmet -> pending;         | unmet -> pending;
--   (default)    | lost  -> pending,         | lost  -> STAYS LIVE,
--                |          recursively      |          notified
--   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
--   optional:true| never gates activation;   | never gates activation;
--                | a change deactivates and  | a change is a
--                | reactivates               | notification, nothing else
--
-- `dynamic` means the plugin has said, IN WRITING, that it can survive its
-- provider being swapped underneath it. It is not the default because most
-- plugins cannot, and the cost of wrongly assuming they can is a live
-- instance holding a dead reference.
--
-- The rebinding-preference axis is deliberately omitted. OSGi has
-- reluctant vs greedy and it is a knob every author must understand to
-- read anyone else's component; we take always-reluctant. Three axes were
-- more than the model can carry across twenty ports.

end

-- The requirements a definition declared, normalized.
--
-- BOTH AXES ARE READ AT TWO LEVELS, AND THE PER-REQUIREMENT ONE WINS.
--
-- The instance-level `policy` and `optional` list are how a DOCUMENT
-- states the axis without editing the definition, and they apply to every
-- requirement. The per-requirement form is the one section 11.1's object
-- syntax exists for, and it is strictly more expressive: an instance that
-- is `static` on its store and `dynamic` on its metrics cannot be written
-- at all at the instance level.
--
-- `optional` unions rather than overriding - both spellings are statements
-- that this requirement need not gate activation, and there is no reading
-- under which one of them means "actually, mandatory".

-- provider.

end

-- Edges that can cause a restart, which is exactly the set a cycle must be
-- detected over (section 11.3).
--
-- ONLY `dynamic` OPTIONAL EDGES ARE EXCLUDED, and they are the ones the
-- exclusion was for: two plugins that optionally and dynamically consume
-- each other's capabilities both activate happily, neither gates on the
-- other, and each is merely notified when the other appears. Nothing
-- restarts, so nothing oscillates.
--
-- An earlier draft of section 11.3 excluded EVERY optional edge and
-- thereby admitted the non-terminating case it was trying to permit.

-- A cycle through restart-causing requirements is
-- `plugin_dependency_cycle`, detected AT LOAD - before anything runs,
-- because the failure it describes is a non-terminating reconcile and the
-- only safe time to report that is before it starts.
--
-- The graph is over capabilities, not refs: an edge runs from a consumer
-- to EVERY node that provides what it needs, because any of them could be
-- the one selected and a cycle through any is a cycle. A node also
-- satisfies its own name as a ref (section 11.1), which is why the ref is
-- a provider of itself here.
--
-- `nodes` is a plain lua array of {ref=, provides=, requires=} records.
function M.dependencycycle(nodes)

  -- matched differently - a capability by its exact name, a ref through
  -- the canonical spelling (section 4 rule 5) - and one map keyed by both
  -- can only do one of them. Keyed by both and looked up raw, as this
  -- was, a cycle spelled `a$`/`b$` found no providers and EVADED the
  -- load-time check that exists to catch a non-terminating reconcile.
