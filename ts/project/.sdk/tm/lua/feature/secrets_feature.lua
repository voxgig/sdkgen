-- ProjectName SDK secrets feature
--
-- Secret access via a vendored @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the
-- access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. The lua port of
-- tm/ts/src/feature/secrets/SecretsFeature.ts, seam for seam with the go
-- port (tm/go/feature/secrets_feature.go), whose structure this target
-- shares: a top-level feature/ container, synchronous hooks that cannot
-- fail an operation, and a transport that both raw paths cross.
--
-- The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
-- credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
-- rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
-- sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
-- provider - a `memory` store named `options` - so an explicit value always
-- wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
--
-- WHY THE TRANSPORT, NOT A HOOK. Every entity op runs feature_hook("PreSpec")
-- before make_spec builds the auth header, so a hook COULD resolve in time -
-- but utility/feature_hook.lua discards a hook's return value, so a PreSpec
-- hook can neither fail an operation nor be awaited, and `direct()` /
-- `graphql()` run no hooks at all. The transport wrapper installed in init
-- is the one seam every wire path crosses: entity ops (make_request), the
-- raw paths (_raw_request) and the exchange retries all come through it. It
-- resolves there, rewrites the authorization header prepare_auth built from
-- the options apikey, and - this is the point - REFUSES TO SEND while the
-- chain is broken.
--
-- MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
-- op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
-- provider ERROR (unreachable vault, bad creds) must FAIL the op: a broken
-- vault never degrades into an unauthenticated request. The same gate holds
-- a construction failure: a `providers` entry that is not a provider or a
-- spec, or a kind this SDK was not generated with, is recorded at init and
-- every request is refused with sekreto's own message. Fail-closed at the
-- one seam every request must pass, and never a silently shortened chain.
--
-- THE RESOLVED CREDENTIAL IS FEATURE STATE, not an options write - go's
-- discipline, kept here for the same reason it is right there: the options
-- map is read raw on every request, and a feature that wrote into it would
-- be racing its own readers in a runtime with coroutines. The header the
-- wire sees is identical, because the wrapper builds it the way prepare_auth
-- does, from the same options.auth.prefix.
--
-- EXCHANGE: some APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What
-- the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived
-- ACCESS token from a token endpoint (`exchange.path`, relative to
-- options.base); the access token is what every request carries, and when
-- a response status in `exchange.statuses` (401) says it is spent the
-- wrapper buys another and retries the same request once. Test mode buys
-- nothing and answers with a deterministic fake token.
--
-- PLUGIN KINDS. The four built-in kinds (env, memory, dotenv, file) come
-- with the vendored core; every other kind is a voxgig/plugin definition
-- the generated config_plugins module hands in, and only the groups the
-- model activated are in the tree at all. Those kinds reach
-- feature/secrets/sekreto/plugins/net.lua, which runs the compiled
-- transport helper (feature/secrets/native/sekreto-net) because Lua 5.4
-- has no sockets and no TLS - `make build` compiles it whenever a plugin
-- group is active, and never otherwise.

-- raises a bare "attempt to index" from inside sekreto, and a nil HOLE in
-- the list ends `ipairs` early and silently SHORTENS the chain - so the
-- classification is done here, with the constructor's message, and the
-- transport gate refuses to send. A shortened chain is exactly the
-- fail-open the gate exists to prevent.
