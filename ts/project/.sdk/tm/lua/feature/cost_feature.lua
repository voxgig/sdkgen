-- ProjectName SDK cost feature
--
-- Cost tracking and spend budget. Uses BOTH seams, which is the point of
-- the feature: money is spent per HTTP ATTEMPT (a retried call is charged
-- again, because the upstream API charges it again), but it is owed by an
-- OPERATION. So the transport wrap prices each attempt, and PreDone
-- attributes the running total to `<entity>.<op>` and to the caller
-- (`ctrl.actor`, the same actor the audit feature records).
--
-- The price of an attempt comes from the first source that answers:
-- a response header (`header` x `perUnit`), the rate table (`rates`, keyed
-- '<entity>.<op>' / '<op>' / '*'), then the flat `unit`. A body figure
-- (`path` x `perUnit`, e.g. "usage.total_tokens") is read at PreDone
-- instead, from the already-parsed result. A body figure describes the
-- whole call, so it REPLACES the per-attempt estimate rather than adding
-- to it.
--
-- `budget` caps total spend. With `onBudget` = "deny" a further operation
-- is refused at PrePoint, before an endpoint is resolved and before
-- anything reaches the network.
--
-- ORDER MATTERS. Cost must sit INSIDE the cache, or a response served
-- from cache is charged for money that was never spent. The default (map)
-- order puts cache innermost and cost outside it, so activate them in
-- array form with cost first.
