# Make the suite runnable with a bare `make test`, the way every other
# target's is.
#
# py-data is the one target that CONSUMES a sibling: its package imports the
# ProjectName SDK generated into ../py of the same repo. The Makefile's `dev`
# target pip-installs both editable, but `test` does not depend on it, so
# `make test` on a fresh clone died in collection with
# "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'projectname_sdk'" — before a single
# assertion ran.
#
# Requiring an install step would also make this target the only one that
# cannot be tested from a clean checkout. Putting the two source roots on
# sys.path keeps it self-contained; an installed copy still wins, because
# these entries are appended only when the import is not already satisfiable.
