# ProjectName Data — credential discovery.
#
# `data()` must work in a fresh Colab cell with no arguments. Analysts do not
# want to construct a client; they want a DataFrame. So the token and base
# URL are looked up through a short, predictable chain and the failure
# message TEACHES rather than merely reports.
#
# Kept generic (the SDK's env-var prefix is passed in) because this file is
# copied verbatim per SDK — only `ProjectName` is substituted at generation
# time, so nothing here may hardcode a per-API name.
