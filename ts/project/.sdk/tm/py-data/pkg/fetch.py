# ProjectName Data — eager paging drain.
#
# Analysts want the whole table now. Lazy iterators are application
# ergonomics: correct for a service processing a stream, wrong for someone
# who typed `df = ad.things()` and wants to run a groupby on the next line.
#
# This module owns NO pagination knowledge. The sibling SDK's `paging`
# feature already normalises every server dialect it understands — a
# `Link: rel="next"` header, X-Page / X-Next-Page / X-Total-Count, or body
# `next` / `cursor` / `nextCursor` / `hasMore` — onto `result.paging`, and
# records the last one on the client. All we do is drive it to exhaustion by
# feeding the cursor/page back in through the per-call `ctrl.paging` hook,
# which exists for exactly this purpose.
