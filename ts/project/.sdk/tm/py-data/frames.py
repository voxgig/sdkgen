# ProjectName Data — records to DataFrame.
#
# The one genuinely new runtime component in this package. Everything else
# either delegates to the sibling ProjectName SDK or is generated.
#
# Pipeline, per accessor call:
#   1. normalise  — SDK dataclasses / dicts / scalars -> plain dicts
#   2. flatten    — one level of nesting -> dotted columns (json_normalize)
#   3. dtype      — model-declared nullable pandas dtypes, coerced safely
#   4. order      — model field order first, extras appended
#
# Step 3 uses NULLABLE dtypes ('Int64', not 'int64') throughout. See the
# PANDAS_DTYPE note in sdkgen's canonType.ts: API payloads omit optional
# fields freely, so a column that looks integral in one page can arrive with
# nulls in the next. NumPy's int64/bool cannot hold NA and would silently
# upcast to float64/object mid-fetch, making a column's dtype depend on which
# rows happened to come back.
