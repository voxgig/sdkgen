// Secret access via a vendored @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the
// access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. The csharp port of
// tm/ts/src/feature/secrets/SecretsFeature.ts - same contract, C# idiom,
// and structurally go's port (tm/go/feature/secrets_feature.go) rather than
// ts's, for the two reasons spelled out below.
//
// The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
// credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
// rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
// sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
// provider - a `memory` store named `options` - so an explicit value always
// wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
// When the option is unset, the remaining providers (env, dotenv, a vault)
// are asked in order, and moving a credential from code to a vault becomes
// a configuration change.
//
// WHY THE CREDENTIAL LIVES IN FEATURE STATE, not in the options map.
// `_rootctx.Options = _options` (Main.fragment.cs) is ONE shared
// Dictionary, and PrepareAuth reads it on every operation
// (`ctx.Client.OptionsMap()`). A Dictionary<K,V> is no more thread-safe
// than a Go map, so a feature that wrote the resolved value there would
// race every concurrent operation - and readers would see a torn map, not
// a stale value. So the resolved credential is held HERE and injected into
// each request at the transport seam; the options map stays frozen after
// construction and every raw read on it is safe. The header the wire sees
// is identical, because the wrapper rebuilds it exactly the way PrepareAuth
// does, from the same options.auth.prefix.
//
// WHY RESOLUTION HAPPENS AT THE TRANSPORT, not in the PreSpec hook.
// `Direct()` and `Graphql()` both funnel through RawRequest, and the
// fragment says it plainly: "like Direct, this bypasses the feature
// pipeline - no retry, ratelimit or paging features apply". NO feature
// hooks run there. The transport delegate is the one seam every wire path
// crosses, so resolving there is what gives the raw paths the same
// credential - and the same fail-closed refusal - as the entity pipeline.
// The header is rewritten AFTER PrepareAuth built it, so the transport is
// exactly early enough.
//
// ONE VISIBLE CONSEQUENCE, worth knowing before it surprises someone:
// ProjectNameSDK.Prepare() returns the fetchdef WITHOUT crossing the
// transport, so its authorization header is the one PrepareAuth built from
// the apikey OPTION - never the chain-resolved credential. Prepare is a
// what-would-I-send inspector; what is actually sent is what Direct,
// Graphql and the entity ops put on the wire, and those all cross the seam.
// (ts can answer differently because its prepare() awaits the feature's own
// resolve; a void C# hook has no equivalent.)
//
// MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
// op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
// provider ERROR (unreachable vault, bad creds) must FAIL the op: a broken
// vault never degrades into an unauthenticated request. C# feature hooks
// are void and cannot fail an operation from PreSpec the way ts's awaited
// hook rejection can - so, like go, the transport is wrapped WHENEVER the
// feature is active and the wrapper refuses to send while resolution
// stands failed. An exception out of the transport becomes `response.Err`
// on the entity path (MakeRequest.cs) and `{ ok: false, err }` on the raw
// path (Main.fragment.cs), so both wire paths honour it.
//
// EXCHANGE: some APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What
// the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived
// ACCESS token from a token endpoint (`exchange.path`, relative to
// options.base); the access token is what every request carries, and when a
// response status in `exchange.statuses` (401) says it is spent the wrapper
// buys another and retries the same request once. Concurrent purchases
// share the one in-flight exchange; test mode buys nothing and answers with
// a deterministic fake token.
//
// A NOTE ON THE VENDORED TREES. Upstream sekreto ships its core and its
// plugins as TWO assemblies, and the header of the vendored Sekreto.cs
// still asserts that boundary ("THE CORE REFERENCES NO PLUGIN, IN ANY
// FORM"). Vendoring compiles both into this one SDK assembly, so the
// msbuild reference graph no longer enforces it. Nothing breaks, but the
// model's plugin trim (feature.secrets.plugin.<group>.active) is now the
// only thing keeping a generated SDK lean.
