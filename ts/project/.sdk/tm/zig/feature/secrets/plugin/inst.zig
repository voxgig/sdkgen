//! The instance and host records.
//!
//! THEY LIVE IN ONE FILE BECAUSE THE CYCLE IS REAL: a definition's
//! callbacks take an instance, an instance points at its host, and a
//! host holds a catalog of definitions. Zig resolves declarations
//! lazily, so it would in fact tolerate the cycle across files — but
//! `catalog.zig` importing `inst.zig` importing `catalog.zig` is a
//! readability trap, and gathering the declarations here is the same
//! shape `c` gets from a forward `typedef`, `ocaml` from `defs.ml` and
//! `haskell` from `Defs.hs`.
