/// on something that can do the job, and which instance is doing it is exactly
/// the configuration detail a plugin must not care about.

/// But A BINDING IS TO AN INSTANCE, not to a capability, which is what decides
/// behaviour when the bound provider leaves while another match remains.

    /// would be undefined in the common case.
