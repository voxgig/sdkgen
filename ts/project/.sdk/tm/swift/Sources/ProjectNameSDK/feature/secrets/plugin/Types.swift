/// The error type, the sort key, and the handful of helpers every module needs.
///
/// EVERY FUNCTION THAT CAN FAIL IS `throws`, and that is this port's defining
/// cost. Rust returns a `Result` and the other ports raise; swift makes the
/// possibility part of the signature, so `try` appears at every call in the
/// chain from `Host.ready` down to `Refs.parseRef`. It is verbose and it is
/// honest: a reader can see from a signature alone whether a call can produce
/// a section 12 error.

/// Every error carries a section 12 code. Ports compare by CODE and never by
/// message: wording is a port's own business, and pinning the words would make
/// every translation a corpus change. The FORMAT, however, is pinned - a
/// parseable message is what makes a log searchable across twenty languages.
