/// Ordering (section 7) - one rule, one place.
///
/// sdkgen grew two special cases in `makeOptions` (`test`, then `station`) and
/// the third was not far off. This sort is the whole replacement, and the tiers
/// are in this order for a reason:
///
///   1 constraints   before/after edges, by ref or by name
///   2 bands         integer, lower first, default 0
///   3 declaration   ties break by `pos`
///
/// CONSTRAINTS BEAT BANDS precisely so the correct tool wins when both are
/// present. A band expresses a genuine cross-cutting layer; a constraint
/// expresses a relationship between two specific things; and a band chosen by
/// trial and error to fix an ordering bug is a bug wearing a number.

/// One node of the sort. An internal shape, never a corpus value.
