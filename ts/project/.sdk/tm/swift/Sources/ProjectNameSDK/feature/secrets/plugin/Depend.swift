///   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
///   mandatory    | unmet -> pending;         | unmet -> pending;

///                |          recursively      |          notified
///   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
///   optional:true| never gates activation;   | never gates activation;
///                | a change deactivates and  | a change is a
///                | reactivates               | notification, nothing else
///
/// `dynamic` means the plugin has said, IN WRITING, that it can survive its
/// provider being swapped underneath it. It is not the default because most
/// plugins cannot, and the cost of wrongly assuming they can is a live instance

/// greedy and it is a knob every author must understand to read anyone else's
/// component; we take always-reluctant. Three axes were more than the model can
/// carry across twenty ports.
