// Cost tracking and spend budget. Uses BOTH seams, which is the point of
// the feature: money is spent per HTTP ATTEMPT (a retried call is charged
// again, because the upstream API charges it again), but it is owed by an
// OPERATION. So the transport wrap prices each attempt, and preDone
// attributes the running total to `<entity>.<op>` and to the caller
// (`ctrl.actor`, the same actor the audit feature records).
//
// The price of an attempt comes from the first source that answers: a
// response header (`header` x `perUnit`), the rate table (`rates`, keyed
// '<entity>.<op>' / '<op>' / '*'), then the flat `unit`. A body figure
// (`path` x `perUnit`, e.g. "usage.total_tokens") is read at preDone
// instead, from the already-parsed result. A body figure describes the
// whole call, so it REPLACES the per-attempt estimate rather than adding
// to it.
//
// `budget` caps total spend. With `onBudget` = "deny" a further operation
// is refused at prePoint, before an endpoint is resolved and before
// anything reaches the network.
//
// ORDER MATTERS. Cost must sit INSIDE the cache, or a response served from
// cache is charged for money that was never spent.
