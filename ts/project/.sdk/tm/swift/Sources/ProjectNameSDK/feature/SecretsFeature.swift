// Secret access via a vendored @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the
// access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. The swift port of
// tm/ts/src/feature/secrets/SecretsFeature.ts - same contract, and (for the
// reasons below) the go file's structure rather than the ts one's.
//
// The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
// credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
// rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
// sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
// provider - a `memory` store named `options` - so an explicit value always
// wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
// When the option is unset, the remaining providers (env, dotenv, a vault)
// are asked in order, and moving a credential from code to a vault becomes
// a configuration change.
//
// WHERE THE CREDENTIAL LIVES. Not in the options map. utility/Prepare.swift's
// prepareAuth calls `ctx.client!.optionsMap()`, which is `clone(options)`,
// on EVERY request, and VMap is a reference type over an ordered dictionary
// - so a feature that wrote the resolved value into the live options map
// (the ts design) would have one thread walking the map while another
// mutated it. The credential is therefore held in FEATURE STATE behind a
// lock, the options map stays frozen after construction, and the
// authorization header is rewritten per request at the transport - built
// the same way prepareAuth builds it, from the same options.auth.prefix, so
// the two cannot drift. This is go's structural deviation, adopted for a
// sharper version of go's own reason.
//
// WHERE RESOLUTION HAPPENS. At the TRANSPORT SEAM, not in the PreSpec hook.
// Resolution is effectively async (providers do IO) while prepareAuth is
// synchronous, and swift's feature hooks cannot fail an operation the way
// ts's awaited hook rejection can. More decisively, ProjectNameSDK.direct()
// and .graphql() run NO feature hooks at all - both funnel through
// rawRequest, which calls `utility.fetcher` directly. The transport is the
// ONE seam every wire path crosses (utility/Make.swift's makeRequest reaches
// it with the identical line), so resolving there is what gives the raw
// paths the same credential the entity pipeline gets, and the same refusal
// when the chain is broken.
//
// MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
// op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
// provider ERROR (unreachable vault, bad creds) FAILS the op: the wrapper
// throws, and both wire paths catch it in-band (rawRequest -> `ok: false` +
// `err`; makeRequest -> `response.err`). A broken vault never degrades into
// an unauthenticated request.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED ON CONSTRUCTION TOO. initFeature cannot fail the client
// constructor the way ts's throwing init does, so anything that made the
// chain impossible (a malformed providers entry, an unknown plugin kind) is
// HELD in `initerr` and the transport gate refuses to send. For that to
// mean anything the wrapper has to be installed BEFORE the chain is built -
// wrap first, build second. Java shipped the opposite order, and its gate
// was dead code: a construction failure returned before the wrap, and a
// misconfigured chain sent ordinary unauthenticated requests.
//
// EXCHANGE: some APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What
// the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived
// ACCESS token from a token endpoint (`exchange.path`, relative to
// options.base); the access token is what every request carries, and when a
// response status in `exchange.statuses` (401) says it is spent the wrapper
// buys another and retries the same request once. Concurrent purchases
// share the one in-flight exchange; test mode buys nothing and answers with
// a deterministic fake token.
//
// FetcherFunc is synchronous `throws`, so go's channel-based shared
// in-flight resolution collapses to a condition variable, and a provider
// ERROR is simply a `throw` out of the wrapper.
