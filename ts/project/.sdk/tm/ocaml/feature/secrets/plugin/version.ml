(* Versions and ranges (§11.2).

   TWO FIELDS AND ONE PREDICATE. A capability declares `version`, a
   concrete version. A requirement declares `range`. A requirement is
   satisfied when the names match, the `match` passes, and the
   provider's `version` falls inside the requirement's `range`. That is
   the whole rule — there is no third field and no second comparison. *)

module V = Value

(* A COMPONENT IS BOUNDED, like a ref is (§4's 1024).

   The grammar admits an unbounded digit sequence, and every language
   then disagrees about what happens past its integer range: JavaScript
   silently loses precision, Go's Atoi errors (and a port ignoring that
   gets 0), C overflows, Python is exact. `satisfies("0",
   "9223372036854775808")` was false in the canonical and true in go,
   from the same corpus.

   2^31-1 because every port has a signed 32-bit integer, and no real
   version has ever needed more. Found by review of the go port. *)
let component_max = 2147483647

(* `^(\d+)(?:\.(\d+))?(?:\.(\d+))?$`, by hand: three components, digits
   only, no leading sign, no empty component. Written out rather than
   handed to `Str` because the bound above has to be checked per
   component anyway, and a regex that matched then needed re-scanning
   would be the worse of both. Answers None for "not a version", and
   Some (parts, overflow). *)
