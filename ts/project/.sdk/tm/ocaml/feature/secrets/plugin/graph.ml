(* Whole-graph resolution (§11.4) — a phase, not a discovery.

   "Activate, and wait in `pending` if you must" is correct and, on its
   own, produces a terrible experience: apply twenty instances against
   a registry missing one thing and you get NINETEEN pending rows and
   no statement of what is actually wrong.

   `resolvegraph` is a PURE FUNCTION of the registry and the intended
   activation set. No callbacks run, no state changes, nothing is
   touched. It answers for the whole graph at once which instances can
   be live, and for each blocked one THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT that is
   unmet, and why.

   The failure mode being designed against is a famous one: OSGi's
   resolver is correct and its diagnostics are legendarily unusable. A
   resolver that says "blocked" without saying WHY has moved the
   problem rather than solved it, so `why` is part of the contract. *)
