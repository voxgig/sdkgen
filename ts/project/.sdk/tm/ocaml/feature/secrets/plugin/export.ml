   THE UNQUALIFIED ALIAS IS THE INTERESTING PART. `retry/client`
   resolves to the UNTAGGED instance if one exists; if not, and exactly
   one tagged instance exports that key, it resolves to that one; if
   two do, it is `plugin_export_ambiguous` — deliberately diverging
   from seneca's silent last-wins, because with multi-instance as a
   headline feature an ambiguous alias is a defect waiting for
   production. *)

(* Answers None for "no such export", which is not an error —
   `export/missing` pins that, and is why the answer is an option
   rather than a null Value. *)

       VALIDATING, not tolerant. The canonical calls [canonref head],
       which RAISES -- so [retry$bad!/client] is [plugin_bad_tag] and
       [2fa/client] is [plugin_bad_name]. Reading it with [tryref]
       turned a configuration typo into an ordinary missing export,
       which is the error the caller most needs to see, silently
       swallowed. *)
