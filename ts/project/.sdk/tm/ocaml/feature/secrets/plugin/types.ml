(* Errors, and the raise mechanism (§12).

   A REAL EXCEPTION. The canonical raises: a failing call abandons the
   rest of the function, and the corpus is full of entries that assert
   exactly what survived a raise mid-sequence (`resource/unwind`,
   `lifecycle/fail`). OCaml has exceptions, so the port uses them —
   unlike `c`, which has to build the same semantics out of
   `setjmp`/`longjmp` and an arena.

   Ports compare by CODE and never by message: wording is a port's own
   business. The FORMAT is pinned, because a parseable message is what
   makes a log searchable across twenty languages. *)
