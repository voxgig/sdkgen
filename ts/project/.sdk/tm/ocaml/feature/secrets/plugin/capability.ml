(* Capabilities (§11.1).

   A DEPENDENCY IS ON A CAPABILITY, NOT ON A REF — because it is a
   dependency on something that can do the job, and which instance is
   doing it is exactly the configuration detail a plugin must not care
   about. (§11.1 makes one narrow exception for a ref, and `host.ml`
   implements it; the ranking here is capabilities only.)

   But A BINDING IS TO AN INSTANCE, not to a capability, which is what
   decides behaviour when the bound provider leaves while another match
   remains. *)

module V = Value

(* PARTIAL MATCH, RECURSING INTO MAPS (§11.1). THIS FUNCTION IS WHAT
   "EVERY LEAF" MEANS, and an earlier draft of the canonical did not
   have it: the check was a scalar compare, which for any compound
   value is reference identity in JavaScript. A requirement and a
   capability are declared in different places and are never the same
   object, so `match: {limits: {max: 5}}` could not be satisfied by ANY
   provider — including one declaring exactly that. Invisible while
   every corpus entry is scalar, which is why the go port found it and
   P2 did not.

   A LIST IS COMPARED LEAF-WISE AT THE SAME LENGTH, not as a subset —
   "the first two of your three regions" is not something `match` can
   say. *)

(* The rank, as a comparison over two candidates. Ordering is a TOTAL
   rank on purpose: without one, "any provider satisfies" is true of

   `store` instances, both resolve green, and behave differently, which
   is precisely the divergence a shared corpus exists to catch. *)
