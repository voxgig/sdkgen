(* ProjectName SDK: the secrets feature.
 *
 * Secret access via a vendored @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the
 * access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. The ocaml port of
 * tm/go/feature/secrets_feature.go - same contract, OCaml idiom - and the
 * first ocaml feature carried as a CONTAINER beside the single-module
 * sdk_features.ml: this file, the vendored trees under feature/secrets/
 * (sekreto/, plugin/, plugins/) and the shipped suite under
 * test/feature/secrets/ are what `target add` trims for a project that never
 * selected `secrets`, and what the generated feature/secrets/feature.mk
 * compiles, in dependency order, when it did.
 *
 * The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
 * credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
 * rather than the only one: when active, the credential is resolved through
 * a sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
 * provider - a `memory` store named `options` - so an explicit value always
 * wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
 *
 * WHERE RESOLUTION HAPPENS. The utility record holds the transport as the
 * mutable closure field `u_fetcher`, and every wire path crosses it: entity
 * ops through make_request, and the raw `direct`/`graphql` paths through
 * raw_request, which run NO feature hooks at all. So, as in go, this feature
 * wraps that field and resolves there - the one seam every request must
 * pass - rather than in the PreSpec hook ts uses. The header was already
 * built by prepare_auth from options.apikey; the wrapper rewrites it from the
 * chain-resolved value, with the same construction and the same
 * suppression rule, on the live fetchdef (whose `headers` map IS the spec's).
 * The shared options map is never written: prepare_auth reads a CLONE of it
 * (client_options_map), so writing the resolved value there would be both a
 * race in a threaded host and invisible to the reader.
 *
 * MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
 * op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
 * provider ERROR (unreachable vault, bad creds) must FAIL the op: a broken
 * vault never degrades into an unauthenticated request. f_init cannot fail
 * client construction the way ts's throwing init does, so the wrapper
 * refuses to send while construction stands failed (`initerr`) or while the
 * last resolution failed. FAIL-CLOSED at the seam, and the wrapper is
 * installed BEFORE the chain is built, so a construction that fails still
 * finds the gate in place.
 *
 * EXCHANGE: some APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What
 * the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived
 * ACCESS token from a token endpoint (`exchange.path`, relative to
 * options.base); the access token is what every request carries, and when
 * a response status in `exchange.statuses` (401) says it is spent the
 * wrapper buys another and retries the same request once. Test mode buys
 * nothing and answers with a deterministic fake token.
 *
 * THE EXCHANGE TRANSPORT. This SDK's core bundles no HTTP client
 * (sdk_runtime.ml fetch_no_transport). The token purchase therefore rides
 * `options.system.fetch` - the RAW platform seam below every wrapper, so no
 * recursion and no routing through the test mock - or, when the generated
 * config activated a plugin group that needs a transport, the vendored
 * sekreto HTTP client handed in as `~transport` (Config_ocaml wires
 * `Http.request` there; OpenSSL is linked on the same condition). With
 * neither, the exchange fails with a NAMED error rather than sending an
 * unauthenticated request. DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE from go/py/ts, whose
 * platforms carry an HTTP client of their own.
 *
 * THE CHAIN'S ENTRIES. An entry of `providers` is a Map (a sekreto
 * ProviderSpec, handed to `Provider.specof`), or a Func - a live provider
 * as a callable: it is asked the secret NAME and answers a Str (a hit), a
 * Null/Noval (a miss) or raises (an error). The ocaml sekreto spec has no
 * slot for a ready-made provider, so a Func becomes a synthesized
 * `providerplugin` definition (kind `custom<n>`, store `custom`) passed in
 * `~plugins` - the same seat the other ports' live-provider entries take.
 * ANYTHING ELSE - a bare kind name, a number, a null hole - is refused at
 * the gate with sekreto's own wording, never dropped: a dropped entry
 * SHORTENS the chain instead of failing it, which is the fail-open this
 * feature exists to prevent. *)
