(* ProjectName SDK primary-utility corpus.
 *
 * Drives the SHARED language-neutral corpus (.sdk/test/test.json -> "primary")
 * through this SDK's request-shaping utilities, so the cases cannot drift from
 * the reference implementation. Each section is looked up with getSpec and
 * executed with runset, as the ts/js reference harness does.
 *
 * ocaml had NO primary-utility suite at all before this: its request-shaping
 * utilities were unverified in every language-neutral sense. The harness is
 * Corpus_runner, shared with the struct corpus.
