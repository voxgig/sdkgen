(* ProjectName SDK primary-utility corpus.
 *
 * Drives the SHARED language-neutral corpus (.sdk/test/test.json -> "primary")
 * through this SDK's request-shaping utilities, so the cases cannot drift from
 * the reference implementation. Each section is looked up by name and executed
 * on the VENDORED @voxgig/omni engine through Omni_resolver, exactly as the
 * ts/js reference harness does.
 *
 * Every section here uses `runset_args`: a `ctx` entry arrives as `args.(0)`,
 * a MAP, which the call site turns into a LIVE typed context, runs the
 * utility on, and writes the observable state back into — which is what
 * makes `match: {ctx: ...}` (retargeted onto `match: {args: {"0": ...}}` by
 * the resolver, decision 3) read the POST-call state rather than a stale
 * pre-call copy.
