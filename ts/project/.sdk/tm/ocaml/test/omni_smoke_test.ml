(* ProjectName SDK omni runner smoke test.
 *
 * Smoke tests for the VENDORED omni runner itself, and for the two
 * load-bearing decisions in Omni_resolver. A runner that cannot FAIL a bad
 * entry would turn every corpus suite vacuously green, so the failure paths
 * are pinned here, not just the happy one. (OCaml peer of ts's
 * test/omni.test.ts, py's test_omni_smoke.py and lua's
 * test/omni_smoke_test.lua.)
 *
 * The spec is built IN MEMORY, in omni's own value model — no fixture file,
 * and no OMNI block (lenient v0, like the shared corpus).
