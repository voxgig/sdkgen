(* JSON text -> voxgig struct value.
 *
 * A dependency-free reader, so the SDK can parse JSON with no opam packages -
 * the same position every other target is in (elixir's ProjectName.Json,
 * clojure's sdk.core/json-parse, the json_parse in c/rust/zig).
 *
 * It lives in the RUNTIME rather than the test tree because the generated
 * config uses it: above a size threshold the API model is emitted as a JSON
 * string constant and parsed here (sdkgen rung L1) instead of as a literal the
 * compiler has to walk. `test/struct_corpus.ml` uses this same function rather
 * than its own copy, so the corpus and the SDK cannot disagree about what a
 * given JSON text means.
 *
 * Numbers are read as Num (float), which is exactly what formatOcamlValue
 * emits for the literal form - so the two representations cannot disagree
 * about the type of a whole number.
