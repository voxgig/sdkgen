/* Extension points (§6). Three kinds, chosen because they are what the
 * two existing systems actually needed, and no more.
 *
 * A PLUGIN NEVER MUTATES THE HOST. That inversion is what makes
 * deactivation possible: sdkgen's `utility.fetcher = wrapped` is not
 * undoable, but "this instance holds slot 3 of the request chain" is
 * undoable in O(1). OSGi named it the whiteboard pattern in 2004, in a
 * paper called *Listeners Considered Harmful*, and for exactly this
 * reason. */

// Mode is §6.1: "fan-out" is not one answer but four. In a language with
// asynchrony, "call every binding" hides a decision — start them all and
// wait, await each in turn, or do not wait — and a design that leaves it
// unsaid gets four different answers from four ports, in the concurrency
// behaviour of production code no corpus entry happens to cover.

/* BindFn IS ONE TYPE FOR ALL THREE KINDS, AND THAT IS A PORT DECISION
 * WORTH STATING.
 *
 * The canonical calls `fn(arg)` for a hook, `fn(next, ...args)` for a
 * chain and `fn(...args)` for a provider — three arities on one
 * untyped slot. Go could give each kind its own func type, but then
 * `bind` needs three spellings and a probe that binds the same
 * function to a hook point in one corpus entry and a provider point in
 * the next (which `point/bail` and `point/provider` do, with the same
 * `provider` probe) could not be written at all.
 *
 * So one variadic signature carries all three, and a chain's `next` is
 * simply its first argument — exactly as in the canonical.
 *
 * A BINDING CANNOT RAISE IN GO. It RETURNS an error value instead, and
 * §6.1's collecting modes gather those. */
