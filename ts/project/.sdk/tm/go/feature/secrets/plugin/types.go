/* Shared types. Deliberately small: the design's §19 budget says the
 * library owns naming, configuration, lifecycle, ordering, binding and
 * teardown, and nothing else.
 *
 * GO IS THE FIRST PORT AND IT CHANGES ONE THING ON PURPOSE (§18, P4):
 * errors are RETURNED, not raised. The canonical raises, and every
 * signature that could fail here returns `error` instead. That is the
 * point of porting Go first — "static-only + typed extension points +
 * explicit errors will find every TypeScript-shaped assumption in the
 * model" — and the corpus compares by CODE, which survives the change
 * intact. */

// OrderRef is ONE spelling or a LIST of them.
//
// plugin used to type this as a bare string, so a list matched nothing and
// was SILENTLY DROPPED - the sort came out as if no constraint had been
// declared. Go could not even represent the input.
//
// `raw` is THE AUTHORED VALUE, kept so normalization can hand the block
// back exactly as written; `List` is the parsed form the sort consumes,
// and `set` says whether the key was stated at all. Canonical does not
// need any of this: it never decodes the block, it assigns it (`ent.order
// = ord`), so every spelling survives untouched. Go is the only port that
// decodes and rebuilds, and a rebuild silently loses whatever it does not
// model. That single cause produced four separate parity breaks - the
// list form, scalar-vs-one-element-list, an authored empty list, an
// authored null - and the corpus could see none of them until
// `config/normorder` was written to assert the block's own shape.
//
// `set` is deliberately not `0 < len(list)`: an authored `[]` states a
// constraint that names nothing, which is NOT the same document as an
// absent key.
//
// `raw` is the ONE source of truth and `list` is a derived cache, both
// unexported. An earlier round exported `List`, which made the value
// mutable from outside and gave it two sources that could disagree: a
// caller mutating the slice it passed in changed what marshalled while
// ResolveOrder kept the old constraint, and editing `List` directly did
// the reverse. A persisted-then-reloaded config could then order
// differently from the live one. NewOrderRef is now the only way to build
// one, it copies what it is given, and Refs() hands back a copy.

// twice over: json.Unmarshal into a string is a documented NO-OP on JSON
// null and returns a nil error, so `{"after":null}` took the string
// branch and came back as `{"after":""}` - an empty-string constraint
// nobody wrote; and having two decoders for one rule let them drift, so
// this path hard-failed on values the in-memory path quietly accepted.

// carrying two ways to construct one value is exactly what let them
// desync.
//
// `marshal`, not `json.Marshal`. The latter escapes `<`, `>` and `&` as
// \u00XX, which canonical's JSON.stringify does not, and an outer encoder
