/* The host: the lifecycle state machine (§5), extension points (§6), and
 * resource capture (§8).
 *
 * TWO RULES SHAPE EVERY METHOD BELOW.
 *
 * Transitions are SEQUENTIAL (§5.2). One at a time, in call order, never
 * interleaved; a transition triggered from inside a lifecycle callback
 * is `plugin_reentrant`. A hard rule, because it is the only way the
 * semantics can be identical in Go, in Ruby and in single-threaded
 * JavaScript.
 *
 * Reconciliation is EAGER (§18's portability budget). A transition
 * settles by running the state machine to a fixed point, not by
 * suspending on a promise. Every port must be able to do the same, and
 * fourteen of them will not have JavaScript's event loop. */
