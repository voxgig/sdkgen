// Secret access via a vendored @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the
// access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. The go port of
// tm/ts/src/feature/secrets/SecretsFeature.ts - same contract, go idiom.
//
// The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
// credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
// rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
// sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
// provider - a `memory` store named `options` - so an explicit value always
// wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
//
// Resolution is effectively ASYNC (providers do IO), and the auth header is
// built by the synchronous prepareAuth inside makeSpec. The bridge is the
// feature hook pipeline: every entity op runs featureHook("PreSpec") before
// makeSpec, so the PreSpec hook below resolves the secret once and writes
// it into the LIVE options map where prepareAuth already looks (ctx.Options
// on the root context IS the options map the client clones for OptionsMap).
// Concurrent operations share the single in-flight resolution.
//
// MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
// op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
// provider ERROR (unreachable vault, bad creds) must FAIL the op: a broken
// vault never degrades into an unauthenticated request. go's feature hooks
// are synchronous and cannot fail an operation from PreSpec the way ts's
// awaited hook rejection can - so, unlike ts, the transport is wrapped
// WHENEVER the feature is active, and the wrapper refuses to send while
// the last resolution stands failed. Fail-closed at the one seam every
// request must pass.
//
// EXCHANGE: some APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What
// the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived
// ACCESS token from a token endpoint (`exchange.path`, relative to
// options.base); the access token is what every request carries, and when
// a response status in `exchange.statuses` (401) says it is spent the
// wrapper buys another and retries the same request once. Concurrent
// purchases share the one in-flight exchange; test mode buys nothing and
// answers with a deterministic fake token.
