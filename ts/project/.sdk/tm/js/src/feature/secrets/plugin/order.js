/* Ordering (§7) — one rule, one place.
 *
 * sdkgen grew two special cases in `makeOptions` (`test`, then
 * `station`) and the third was not far off. This sort is the whole
 * replacement, and the tiers are in this order for a reason:
 *
 *   1 constraints   before/after edges, by ref or by name
 *   2 bands         integer, lower first, default 0
 *   3 declaration   ties break by `pos`
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS BEAT BANDS precisely so the correct tool wins when both
 * are present. A band expresses a genuine cross-cutting layer; a
 * constraint expresses a relationship between two specific things; and a
 * band chosen by trial and error to fix an ordering bug is a bug wearing
 * a number. */

 * architecture, which is a different kind of claim and must not lose a
