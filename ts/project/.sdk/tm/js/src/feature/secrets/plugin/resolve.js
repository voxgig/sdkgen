/* Dynamic resolution (§10.2) — name to candidate module ids.
 *
 * PURE. It returns the ids a host WOULD try, in order; it does not load
 * anything. That separation is what lets the corpus pin resolution in
 * every language including those with no dynamic loading at all, and it
 * is why §15.4 puts real module loading in per-port integration tests
 * rather than here. */

/** A MODULE PATH IS NOT A NAME (§10.2). The ref grammar starts a name

 * reaches candidate generation — seneca allows a path where a plugin
 * name goes, and this design deliberately does not, because a ref is an
 * ADDRESS WITHIN A HOST and a path is a LOCATION ON A DISK.
 *
 * Loading from an explicit location is a separate field that bypasses
 * candidate generation entirely: `from` is passed to the resolver
 * verbatim, and a resolver that cannot honour a location raises
 * plugin_resolve_failed. */
