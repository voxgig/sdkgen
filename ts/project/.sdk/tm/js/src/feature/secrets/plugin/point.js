/* Extension points (§6). Three kinds, chosen because they are what the
 * two existing systems actually needed, and no more.
 *
 * A PLUGIN NEVER MUTATES THE HOST. That inversion is what makes
 * deactivation possible: sdkgen's `utility.fetcher = wrapped` is not
 * undoable, but "this instance holds slot 3 of the request chain" is
 * undoable in O(1). OSGi named it the whiteboard pattern in 2004, in a
 * paper called *Listeners Considered Harmful*, and for exactly this
 * reason. */

 * unsaid gets four different answers from four ports, in the concurrency
 * behaviour of production code no corpus entry happens to cover. */
