//! Shared types. Deliberately small: the design's §19 budget says the
//! library owns naming, configuration, lifecycle, ordering, binding and
//! teardown, and nothing else.
//!
//! RUST FOLLOWS GO'S ONE DELIBERATE CHANGE (§18, P4): errors are RETURNED,
//! not raised. Every fallible signature is `Result<_, PluginError>`, and
//! the corpus compares by CODE, which survives the change intact.
