//! Extension points (§6). Three kinds, chosen because they are what the
//! two existing systems actually needed, and no more.
//!
//! A PLUGIN NEVER MUTATES THE HOST. That inversion is what makes
//! deactivation possible: sdkgen's `utility.fetcher = wrapped` is not
//! undoable, but "this instance holds slot 3 of the request chain" is
//! undoable in O(1). OSGi named it the whiteboard pattern in 2004, in a
//! paper called *Listeners Considered Harmful*, and for exactly this
//! reason.
