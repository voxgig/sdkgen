    # open object and one setprop does both.
    #
    # Without the replace half this was a no-op: every entry went to
    # `utility.custom`, which nothing reads, so a caller passing
    # `"utility" => {"fetcher" => my_transport}` - the documented way to
    # script the transport, and the seam the shared feature corpus runs on -
    # was silently ignored while ts and js honoured it.
    #
    # Option keys are camelCase, as ts spells them; members here are
    # snake_case. Converting rather than listing keeps the mapping to one
    # rule, so a utility added later is overridable without touching this.
