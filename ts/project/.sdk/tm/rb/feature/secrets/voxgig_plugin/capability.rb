# Capabilities (section 11.1).
#
# A DEPENDENCY IS ON A CAPABILITY, NOT ON A REF - because it is a
# dependency on something that can do the job, and which instance is
# doing it is exactly the configuration detail a plugin must not care
# about.
#
# But A BINDING IS TO AN INSTANCE, not to a capability, which is what
# decides behaviour when the bound provider leaves while another match
# remains.

module VoxgigPlugin
  # Rank the matching live providers and return them best-first: highest
  # `version`, then LOWEST `priority` (default 0), then declaration
  # position `pos` ascending.
  #
  # `priority` is a field on the capability rather than section 7's
  # `order` band, because bands live on POINT BINDINGS: a provider may
  # have several bindings with different bands, or none at all, so a rank
  # reaching for one would be undefined in the common case.
  #
  # Without a total rank, "any provider satisfies" is true of the GRAPH
  # and useless to the PLUGIN - two ports could bind different `store`
  # instances, both resolve green, and behave differently, which is
  # precisely the divergence a shared corpus exists to catch.
  def self.resolve_capability(req, candidates)
    hits = candidates.select { |c| matches(req, c['provides'] || {}) }
    # STABLE: Ruby's sort is not, and the rank falls through to `pos`.

    version = prov['version']
    # An ABSENT version sorts LAST, whatever the other is - "no version"
    # loses to every version rather than being read as 0.0.0. The leading
    # flag is what expresses that in a sort KEY rather than a comparator.
    [version.nil? ? 1 : 0,
     version.nil? ? [0, 0, 0] : version_parts(version).map { |n| -n },

    # `match` is checked against the provider's `attrs`, key by key. A

    # by a provider that never said.

  # PARTIAL MATCH, RECURSING INTO MAPS (section 11.1).
  #
  # Section 11.1 defines `match` as "a partial match against `attrs`,
  # with exactly the semantics voxgig/struct and the omni corpus already
  # define for `match` - every leaf in the requirement must be present
  # and equal in the capability, keys not mentioned are not checked."
  #
  # Equality is by JSON TYPE as well as value: `transactional: 1` does
  # not satisfy `transactional: true`. RUBY NEEDS NO GUARD FOR THAT -
  # `true == 1` is already false, because TrueClass and Integer are
  # different classes with no coercion between them. Python, PHP, Perl
  # and Lua all need one, and `capability/match` pins the behaviour for
  # every port rather than trusting each language's `==`.
  #
  # An explicit `boolean?(want) != boolean?(got)` check was written here
  # first and then removed: it could never fire, and a guard that cannot
  # fire is dead code that reads as protection. A mutation deleting it
  # survived the corpus, which is what a non-mutation looks like.
  #
  # A LIST IS COMPARED LEAF-WISE AT THE SAME LENGTH, not as a subset.
