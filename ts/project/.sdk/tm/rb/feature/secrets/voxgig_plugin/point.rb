# Extension points (section 6). Three kinds, chosen because they are what
# the two existing systems actually needed, and no more.
#
# A PLUGIN NEVER MUTATES THE HOST. That inversion is what makes
# deactivation possible: sdkgen's `utility.fetcher = wrapped` is not
# undoable, but "this instance holds slot 3 of the request chain" is
# undoable in O(1). OSGi named it the whiteboard pattern in 2004, in a
# paper called *Listeners Considered Harmful*, and for exactly this
# reason.

  # Section 6.1: "fan-out" is not one answer but four. In a language with
  # asynchrony, "call every binding" hides a decision - start them all
  # and wait, await each in turn, or do not wait - and a design that
  # leaves it unsaid gets four different answers from four ports, in the
  # concurrency behaviour of production code no corpus entry happens to
  # cover.

      # way to say nothing, and the model's rule is written to that
      # rather than to JavaScript's null/undefined pair. `unless
