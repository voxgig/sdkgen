# Ordering (section 7) - one rule, one place.
#
# sdkgen grew two special cases in `makeOptions` (`test`, then `station`)
# and the third was not far off. This sort is the whole replacement, and
# the tiers are in this order for a reason:
#
#   1 constraints   before/after edges, by ref or by name
#   2 bands         integer, lower first, default 0
#   3 declaration   ties break by `pos`
#
# CONSTRAINTS BEAT BANDS precisely so the correct tool wins when both are
# present. A band expresses a genuine cross-cutting layer; a constraint
# expresses a relationship between two specific things; and a band chosen
# by trial and error to fix an ordering bug is a bug wearing a number.

  # A PIN IS NOT A CONSTRAINT (section 7).

  # Constraints and bands are negotiable by definition - they are what
  # plugins and documents say they want, and the sort's job is to satisfy
  # them all. A pin is the host stating a structural invariant of its own
  # architecture, which is a different kind of claim and must not lose a
  # tie to a document.

  # So a pin PLACES the binding at the named end, and an ordering that
  # would move it away is `plugin_order_pinned` - rejected, not honoured
  # into a broken wrap.

    # pinned to the same end are order-sensitive (`{b:'first',
    # a:'first'}` and `{a:'first', b:'first'}` give different results).
    # Ruby hashes are insertion-ordered and a Go map has no order at all,
    # so leaving it unstated made the same declaration mean different
    # things in different ports.
