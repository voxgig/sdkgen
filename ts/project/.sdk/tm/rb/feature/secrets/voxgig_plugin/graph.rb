# Whole-graph resolution (section 11.4) - a phase, not a discovery.
#
# "Activate, and wait in `pending` if you must" is correct and, on its
# own, produces a terrible experience: apply twenty instances against a
# registry missing one thing and you get NINETEEN pending rows and no
# statement of what is actually wrong.
#
# `resolve_graph` is a PURE FUNCTION of the registry and the intended
# activation set. No callbacks run, no state changes, nothing is touched.
# It answers for the whole graph at once which instances can be live, and
# for each blocked one THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT that is unmet, and why.
#
# The failure mode being designed against is a famous one: OSGi's
# resolver is correct and its diagnostics are legendarily unusable. A
# resolver that says "blocked" without saying WHY has moved the problem
# rather than solved it, so `why` is part of the contract and the corpus
# pins its shape.
