# Shared types. Deliberately small: the design's section 19 budget says
# the library owns naming, configuration, lifecycle, ordering, binding
# and teardown, and nothing else.
#
# RUBY'S ONE STRUCTURAL HAZARD IS SORT STABILITY. Array#sort and
# #sort_by are NOT guaranteed stable, and the canonical leans on
# JavaScript's stable sort in three places. Every sort in this port goes
# through `Util.stable_sort_by`, which decorates with the original index.
