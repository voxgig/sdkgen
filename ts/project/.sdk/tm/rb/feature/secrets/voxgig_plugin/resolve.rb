# Dynamic resolution (section 10.2) - name to candidate module ids.
#
# PURE. It returns the ids a host WOULD try, in order; it does not load
# anything. That separation is what lets the corpus pin resolution in
# every language including those with no dynamic loading at all, and it
# is why section 15.4 puts real module loading in per-port integration
# tests rather than here.

  # name goes, and this design deliberately does not, because a ref is an
  # ADDRESS WITHIN A HOST and a path is a LOCATION ON A DISK.
