# ProjectName SDK secrets feature
#
# Secret access via a vendored voxgig_sekreto provider chain, and the
# access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. The ruby port of
# tm/ts/src/feature/secrets/SecretsFeature.ts - same contract, ruby idiom,
# and structurally go's (tm/go/feature/secrets_feature.go), for the reason
# spelled out under RESOLUTION LIVES AT THE TRANSPORT below.
#
# The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
# credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
# rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
# sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
# provider - a `memory` store named 'options' - so an explicit value always
# wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
# When the option is unset, the remaining providers (env, dotenv, a vault)
# are asked in order, and moving a credential from code to a vault becomes
# a configuration change.
#
# RESOLUTION LIVES AT THE TRANSPORT, not in the PreSpec hook. `direct()`
# and `graphql()` reach the wire through ProjectNameSDK#raw_request, which
# runs NO feature hooks at all - so a hook-only design would leave the raw
# paths silently unauthenticated, and would have no way to refuse them when
# the chain is broken. The transport is the ONE seam every wire path
# crosses (utility/make_request.rb and Main's raw_request both call
# `utility.fetcher`), so the wrapper installed in `init` resolves there,
# rewrites the authorization header prepare_auth built, and refuses the
# request outright when a provider errors.
#
# MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
# op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
# provider ERROR (unreachable vault, bad credentials) must FAIL the op: a
# broken vault never degrades into an unauthenticated request. The wrapper
# answers `[nil, ctx.make_error("secrets_provider", ...)]`, which the
# entity pipeline turns into a raised ProjectNameError and the raw paths
# report as `{ "ok" => false, "err" => ... }`.
#
# EXCHANGE: some APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What
# the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived
# ACCESS token from a token endpoint (`exchange.path`, relative to
# options.base); the access token is what every request carries, and when a
# response status in `exchange.statuses` (401) says it is spent the wrapper
# buys another and retries the same request once. Test mode buys nothing
# and answers with a deterministic fake token.
#
# THREADS: ruby has real ones. The resolved credential, the in-flight
# resolution and the in-flight purchase are each guarded, and the state
# mutex is always the innermost lock so the three can never deadlock.
