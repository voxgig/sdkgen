# ProjectName SDK concurrency test
#
# Requests in flight at once on one client. Each resolves its operation
# through the cache the client's root context shares with every request, and
# registers and cleans secrets through the one registry the client holds.
#
# The interpreter switches threads about every 100ms, so each test runs long
# enough to be switched in the middle of a resolution or a registration.
