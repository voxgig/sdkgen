# Behavioural tests for the secrets feature (vendored voxgig_sekreto) - the
# ruby port of tm/ts/test/feature/secrets/Secrets.test.ts.
#
# The contract under test: the `apikey` OPTION keeps its exact old meaning
# and always wins, because the feature places it FIRST in the provider chain
# (a `memory` store named 'options') - explicit-beats-lookup falls out of
# sekreto's first-hit rule rather than from special-case logic. With the
# feature inactive nothing changes at all. With it active and the option
# unset, the chain (env, a custom provider, a vault) supplies the credential
# instead.
#
# This file lives in the test `feature/` container on purpose: `target add`
# trims it, along with the feature source and the vendored library, for a
# project whose model does not select `secrets`.
#
# The credential is asserted ON THE WIRE: a live-mode client with a
# recording system.fetch, driven through real entity operations AND through
# `direct()`. An options-level assertion would pass for a port that never
# consults the value, and the raw paths run NO feature hooks - which is
# exactly why resolution lives at the transport seam.
