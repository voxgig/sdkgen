# ProjectName SDK feature corpus test
#
# Feature behaviour, driven by the SHARED corpus.
#
# The same route primary_utility_test.rb takes for the utilities:
# language-neutral cases in .sdk/test/test.json, executed against THIS
# generated SDK. The feature is the ordinary class, built by the generated
# config, installed by the generated constructor, and driven by a real entity
# operation. Not a miniature of the pipeline, which can only be as right as
# the miniature.
#
# Everything in a case is data. The one piece ruby writes for itself is
# turning scripted responses into a fetcher, through the documented
# `utility.fetcher` override.
