// A custom provider given as a MAP of callables, adapted to the object
// shape sekreto's chain reads.
//
// ts accepts `{ lookup() {...}, describe() {...} }` verbatim because a JS
// object literal survives the options clone with its functions intact.
// PHP's `Struct::clone` flattens a class INSTANCE to a stdClass (methods
// lost) while CLOSURES survive, so the array-of-callables IS the shape that
// reaches this feature - the exact parallel of the ts contract, and the
// same adaptation py's `_LiveProvider` makes for the same reason.
//
// php's Provider is a NOMINAL interface, unlike go's structural one, so a
// provider written as a real class must `implements \Voxgig\Sekreto\Provider`
// and be handed in a way the clone cannot flatten (sekreto's own
// ProviderSpec array is the portable route).

// Secret access via a vendored @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the
// access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. The php port of
// tm/ts/src/feature/secrets/SecretsFeature.ts - same contract, php idiom,
// and structurally go's (tm/go/feature/secrets_feature.go), for the reason
// spelled out under RESOLUTION LIVES AT THE TRANSPORT below.
//
// The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
// credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
// rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
// sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
// provider - a `memory` store named 'options' - so an explicit value always
// wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
// When the option is unset, the remaining providers (env, dotenv, a vault)
// are asked in order, and moving a credential from code to a vault becomes
// a configuration change.
//
// RESOLUTION LIVES AT THE TRANSPORT, not in the PreSpec hook. `direct()`
// and `graphql()` reach the wire through ProjectNameSDK::raw_request, which
// runs NO feature hooks at all - its own comment says so - so a hook-only
// design would leave the raw paths silently unauthenticated, and would have
// no way to refuse them when the chain is broken. The transport is the ONE
// seam every wire path crosses (utility/MakeRequest.php and Main's
// raw_request both call `$utility->fetcher`), so the wrapper installed in
// init() resolves there, rewrites the authorization header prepare_auth
// built, and refuses the request outright when a provider errors.
//
// MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
// op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
// provider ERROR (unreachable vault, bad credentials) must FAIL the op: a
// broken vault never degrades into an unauthenticated request. The wrapper
// answers `[null, $ctx->make_error('secrets_provider', ...)]`, which the
// entity pipeline turns into a thrown ProjectNameError and the raw paths
// report as `['ok' => false, 'err' => ...]`.
//
// EXCHANGE: some APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What
// the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived
// ACCESS token from a token endpoint (`exchange.path`, relative to
// options.base); the access token is what every request carries, and when a
// response status in `exchange.statuses` (401) says it is spent the wrapper
// buys another and retries the same request once. Test mode buys nothing
// and answers with a deterministic fake token.
