/**
 * The host: the lifecycle state machine (§5), extension points (§6), and
 * resource capture (§8).
 *
 * TWO RULES SHAPE EVERY METHOD BELOW.
 *
 * Transitions are SEQUENTIAL (§5.2). One at a time, in call order, never
 * interleaved; a transition triggered from inside a lifecycle callback is
 * `plugin_reentrant`. A hard rule, because it is the only way the
 * semantics can be identical in Go, in PHP and in single-threaded
 * JavaScript.
 *
 * Reconciliation is EAGER (§18's portability budget). A transition settles
 * by running the state machine to a fixed point, not by suspending on a
 * promise.
 *
 * AND ONE RULE SHAPES THE SHAPE. A PHP array is a VALUE: reading an
 * instance record out of the registry copies it, and writing to the copy
 * changes nothing. Every record the host mutates is therefore an `Entry`
 * OBJECT, and `Inst` holds that object rather than an array.
