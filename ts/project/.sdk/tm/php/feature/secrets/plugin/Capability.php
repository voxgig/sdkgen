 * it is exactly the configuration detail a plugin must not care about.

 * instances, both resolve green, and behave differently, which is

 * the semantics voxgig/struct and the omni corpus already define for
 * `match` - every leaf in the requirement must be present and equal in the
 * capability, keys not mentioned are not checked."
 *
 * Equality is by JSON TYPE as well as value: `transactional: 1` does not
 * satisfy `transactional: true`. PHP NEEDS THE GUARD RUBY DOES NOT -
 * `true == 1` is true here, and `0 == ''` was true before PHP 8 - so every
 * leaf goes through `samescalar`, which compares booleans only to
 * booleans and null only to null while still reading JSON's one number
 * type across PHP's int and float.
 *
 * A LIST IS COMPARED LEAF-WISE AT THE SAME LENGTH, not as a subset.

 * used `===` throughout would fail on a value that arrived through
 * arithmetic rather than through the parser. No corpus entry currently
 * mixes the two spellings, and a mutation making this branch strict
 * survives; it stays because the cost of being wrong about it is a false
 * failure in a port that did nothing wrong.
 *
 * AND THERE IS NO BOOLEAN GUARD, though `true == 1` is true in PHP. One
 * was written here first and removed: `is_int(true)` and `is_float(null)`
 * are both false, so a boolean or a null never reaches the numeric
 * comparison and falls to `===` regardless. A mutation deleting the guard
 * survived the corpus, which is what a guard that cannot fire looks like.
