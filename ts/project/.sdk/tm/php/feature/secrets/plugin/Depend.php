/**
 * Dependency cardinality, policy, and the restart graph (§11.3).
 *
 * TWO AXES, BOTH DECLARED BY THE DEFINITION THAT HAS THE REQUIREMENT,
 * because only it knows what it can cope with:
 *
 *                | static (default)          | dynamic
 *   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
 *   mandatory    | unmet -> pending;         | unmet -> pending;
 *   (default)    | lost  -> pending,         | lost  -> STAYS LIVE,
 *                |          recursively      |          notified
 *   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
 *   optional:true| never gates activation;   | never gates activation;
 *                | a change deactivates and  | a change is a
 *                | reactivates               | notification, nothing else
 *
 * `dynamic` means the plugin has said, IN WRITING, that it can survive its
 * provider being swapped underneath it. It is not the default because most
 * plugins cannot, and the cost of wrongly assuming they can is a live
 * instance holding a dead reference.
 *
 * The rebinding-preference axis is deliberately omitted. OSGi has
 * reluctant vs greedy and it is a knob every author must understand to
 * read anyone else's component; we take always-reluctant. Three axes were
 * more than the model can carry across twenty ports.

 * exists for, and it is strictly more expressive: an instance that is
 * `static` on its store and `dynamic` on its metrics cannot be written at
