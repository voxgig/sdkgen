/**
 * Ordering (§7) - one rule, one place.
 *
 * sdkgen grew two special cases in `makeOptions` (`test`, then `station`)
 * and the third was not far off. This sort is the whole replacement, and
 * the tiers are in this order for a reason:
 *
 *   1 constraints   before/after edges, by ref or by name
 *   2 bands         integer, lower first, default 0
 *   3 declaration   ties break by `pos`
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS BEAT BANDS precisely so the correct tool wins when both are
 * present. A band expresses a genuine cross-cutting layer; a constraint
 * expresses a relationship between two specific things; and a band chosen
 * by trial and error to fix an ordering bug is a bug wearing a number.
