# ProjectName SDK secrets feature test
#
# Behavioural tests for the secrets feature (vendored @voxgig/sekreto).
#
# The contract under test: the `apikey` OPTION keeps its exact old meaning
# and always wins, because the feature places it FIRST in the provider
# chain (a `memory` store named `options`) - explicit-beats-lookup falls
# out of sekreto's first-hit rule rather than from special-case logic.
# With the feature inactive nothing changes at all. With it active and the
# option unset, the chain (env, dotenv, a custom provider, a vault)
# supplies the credential instead.
#
# EVERY ASSERTION IS MADE ON THE WIRE, not on the harness.
#
# This port resolves at the TRANSPORT SEAM (feature/secrets_feature.pm),
# so the credential is not visible in prepare()'s fetchdef and there is no
# useful in-process proxy for "a request went out". Each client below is
# therefore a LIVE one whose `system.fetch` is the counter - the real
# transport the SDK reaches through utility/fetcher.pm - and never
# ProjectNameSDK->test, whose test feature REPLACES that transport with an
# in-memory mock. Under the mock, "no request was sent" holds for a
# healthy SDK carrying no secrets feature at all, so the assertion would
# pin nothing.
#
# For the same reason every fail-closed case carries a CONTROL leg: the
# same construction with a WORKING provider must reach the same transport
# exactly once, carrying the credential. Only then does a zero from the
# broken provider mean REFUSED rather than UNWIRED.
#
# This file lives in a `feature/` container on purpose: `target add` trims
# it, along with the feature source and the vendored library, for a
# project whose model does not select `secrets`.
