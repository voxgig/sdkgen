  # A key naming a real utility member REPLACES it; anything else is attached
  # as a custom extra. This mirrors ts, where the utility is an open object
  # and one setprop does both.
  #
  # Without the replace half this was a no-op: every entry went to
  # `{utility}{custom}`, which nothing reads, so a caller passing
  # `utility => { fetcher => $my_transport }` - the documented way to script
  # the transport, and the seam the shared feature corpus runs on - was
  # silently ignored while ts and js honoured it.
  #
  # Option keys are camelCase, as ts spells them; members here are
  # snake_case. Converting rather than listing keeps the mapping to one rule,
  # so a utility added later is overridable without touching this. The
  # registrar has already populated every member, so `exists` is the test for
  # "is this a real one" - once the key is known to be a PUBLIC name.

  # Voxgig::Struct::clone would flatten a blessed feature to a plain
  # unblessed hash (and validate rejects the key outright), so the RAW

  # the optspec default - transmitting the credential the caller withheld - or
  # REJECTED outright. Withhold the key for validate, then put the undef back.
  # Same fix as ts/js/go make_options.
