# ProjectName SDK secrets feature
#
# Secret access via a vendored @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the
# access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. The perl port of
# tm/ts/src/feature/secrets/SecretsFeature.ts - same contract, perl idiom,
# and the GO port's structure (see THE TRANSPORT SEAM below).
#
# The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
# credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
# rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
# sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
# provider - a `memory` store named `options` - so an explicit value always
# wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
# When the option is unset, the remaining providers (env, dotenv, a vault)
# are asked in order, and moving a credential from code to a vault becomes
# a configuration change.
#
# MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
# op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
# provider ERROR (unreachable vault, bad creds) must FAIL the op: a broken
# vault never degrades into an unauthenticated request. Voxgig::Sekreto
# spells that difference exactly - `try` returns undef on a miss and DIES
# on a provider error - so the rule is inherited rather than reimplemented.
#
# THE TRANSPORT SEAM, and why this port follows go rather than ts.
#
# ProjectNameSDK::prepare() runs NO feature hooks - it calls prepare_auth
# directly - and _raw_request (which BOTH direct() and graphql() funnel
# through) reaches the wire through it. A feature that resolved only in
# PreSpec would leave those two paths unauthenticated and never notice,
# which is why the py port had to bolt an explicit resolve seam into its
# generated client. perl needs none: entity ops (utility/make_request.pm),
# direct() and graphql() all call `$utility->{fetcher}` on contexts that
# INHERIT the one utility object this feature wraps in init - so wrapping
# the fetcher covers every wire path at once, with no edit to the
# generated client.
#
# So the resolved credential lives in FEATURE STATE (`cred`) and the
# Authorization header is rewritten HERE, at the seam, the same way
# prepare_auth builds it (utility/prepare_auth.pm) and honouring the same
# `auth => undef` suppression. The shared options map is never written.
#
# EXCHANGE: some APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What
# the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived
# ACCESS token from a token endpoint (`exchange.path`, relative to
# options.base); the access token is what every request carries, and when
# a response status in `exchange.statuses` (401) says it is spent the
# wrapper buys another and retries the same request once. Test mode buys
# nothing and answers with a deterministic fake token.
