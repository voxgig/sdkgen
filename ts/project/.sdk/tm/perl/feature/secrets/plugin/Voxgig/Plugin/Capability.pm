# dependency on something that can do the job, and which instance is doing
# it is exactly the configuration detail a plugin must not care about.
#
# But A BINDING IS TO AN INSTANCE, not to a capability, which is what
# decides behaviour when the bound provider leaves while another match
# remains.

# band, because bands live on POINT BINDINGS: a provider may have several
# bindings with different bands, or none at all, so a rank reaching for one
# would be undefined in the common case.
#
# Without a total rank, "any provider satisfies" is true of the GRAPH and
# useless to the PLUGIN - two ports could bind different `store` instances,
# both resolve green, and behave differently, which is precisely the
# divergence a shared corpus exists to catch.

# PARTIAL MATCH, RECURSING INTO MAPS (section 11.1).

# Section 11.1 defines `match` as "a partial match against `attrs`, with
# exactly the semantics voxgig/struct and the omni corpus already define
# for `match` - every leaf in the requirement must be present and equal in
# the capability, keys not mentioned are not checked."
#
# Equality is by JSON TYPE as well as value, and PERL HAS NO JSON TYPES:
# `1 == "1"` and `1 == !!1` are both true here, and the corpus pins both as
# different (capability/match). So every leaf goes through `samescalar`,
# which asks `jsontype` first and compares second.
#
# A LIST IS COMPARED LEAF-WISE AT THE SAME LENGTH, not as a subset.
