# The host: the lifecycle state machine (section 5), extension points
# (section 6), and resource capture (section 8).
#
# TWO RULES SHAPE EVERY METHOD BELOW.
#
# Transitions are SEQUENTIAL (section 5.2). One at a time, in call order,
# never interleaved; a transition triggered from inside a lifecycle
# callback is `plugin_reentrant`. A hard rule, because it is the only way
# the semantics can be identical in Go, in Perl and in single-threaded
# JavaScript.
#
# Reconciliation is EAGER (section 18's portability budget). A transition
# settles by running the state machine to a fixed point, not by suspending
# on a promise.
#
# A PERL HASH HAS NO ORDER, and a deliberately randomized one at that.
# Every walk of the registry here sorts its keys first: `sort keys %$inst`
# is not tidiness, it is the difference between a deterministic teardown
# and one that changes between runs of the same process.
