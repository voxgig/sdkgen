# Shared types. Deliberately small: the design's section 19 budget says
# the library owns naming, configuration, lifecycle, ordering, binding and
# teardown, and nothing else.
#
# PERL'S ONE STRUCTURAL HAZARD IS THAT IT HAS NO JSON TYPES. A scalar that
# holds 1 and a scalar that holds "1" are the same thing to `==` and to
# `eq`, and the corpus pins them as DIFFERENT (capability/match). So this
# file carries `jsontype`, which reads the SV's own flags - the same test
# JSON::PP uses to decide whether to emit a number - and every comparison
# in the port goes through it.
#
# The second hazard is that a hash has NO ORDER, and a randomized one at
# that. Every place the canonical iterates a map, this port sorts the keys
# first; `sortstrings` is the one spelling of that.

# `is_bool` is 5.36's, and it is the only reason this port can tell `true`
# from `1` at all - perl's own booleans ARE 1 and "", and nothing else in
# the language distinguishes them. The corpus runner converts JSON::PP's
# blessed booleans to native ones on the way in, so both spellings answer
# 'bool' here.
#
# THE NUMBER TEST HAS A KNOWN LIMIT, and it is perl's rather than this
# port's: using a numeric scalar in STRING context sets its POK flag
# permanently, after which it reads as a string. JSON::PP's encoder has
# exactly the same limit for exactly the same reason. Nothing in this port
# interpolates a corpus value before comparing it, and `same` would report
# a loud disagreement rather than a quiet pass if something ever did.
