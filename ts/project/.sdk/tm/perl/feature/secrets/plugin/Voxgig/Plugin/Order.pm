# Ordering (section 7) - one rule, one place.
#
# sdkgen grew two special cases in `makeOptions` (`test`, then `station`)
# and the third was not far off. This sort is the whole replacement, and
# the tiers are in this order for a reason:
#
#   1 constraints   before/after edges, by ref or by name
#   2 bands         integer, lower first, default 0
#   3 declaration   ties break by `pos`
#
# CONSTRAINTS BEAT BANDS precisely so the correct tool wins when both are
# present. A band expresses a genuine cross-cutting layer; a constraint
# expresses a relationship between two specific things; and a band chosen
# by trial and error to fix an ordering bug is a bug wearing a number.

# A PIN IS NOT A CONSTRAINT (section 7).

# architecture, which is a different kind of claim and must not lose a tie
# to a document.

# move it away is `plugin_order_pinned` - rejected, not honoured into a
