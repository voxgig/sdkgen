# Dependency cardinality, policy, and the restart graph (section 11.3).
#
# TWO AXES, BOTH DECLARED BY THE DEFINITION THAT HAS THE REQUIREMENT,
# because only it knows what it can cope with:
#
#                | static (default)          | dynamic
#   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
#   mandatory    | unmet -> pending;         | unmet -> pending;
#   (default)    | lost  -> pending,         | lost  -> STAYS LIVE,
#                |          recursively      |          notified
#   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
#   optional:true| never gates activation;   | never gates activation;
#                | a change deactivates and  | a change is a
#                | reactivates               | notification, nothing else
#
# `dynamic` means the plugin has said, IN WRITING, that it can survive its
# provider being swapped underneath it. It is not the default because most
# plugins cannot, and the cost of wrongly assuming they can is a live
# instance holding a dead reference.
#
# The rebinding-preference axis is deliberately omitted. OSGi has reluctant
# vs greedy and it is a knob every author must understand to read anyone
# else's component; we take always-reluctant. Three axes were more than the
# model can carry across twenty ports.

# syntax exists for, and it is strictly more expressive: an instance that
# is `static` on its store and `dynamic` on its metrics cannot be written
# at all at the instance level.
#
# `optional` unions rather than overriding - both spellings are statements
# that this requirement need not gate activation, and there is no reading
# under which one of them means "actually, mandatory".
