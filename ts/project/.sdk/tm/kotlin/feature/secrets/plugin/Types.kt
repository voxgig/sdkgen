/**
 * The value model, the error type, and the JSON writer.
 *
 * THE VALUE MODEL IS `Any?`, and each JSON type has ONE kotlin spelling:
 * `null`, [Boolean], [Double], [String], `List<Any?>`, `Map<String, Any?>`.
 * A map is always a [java.util.TreeMap] - every port has to sort its keys
 * before iterating, and a sorted map makes that the default rather than a
 * discipline to remember.
 *
 * A NUMBER IS ALWAYS A `Double`, because JSON has one number type and the
 * canonical is javascript. A `Long` anywhere in this data would compare
 * unequal to the `Double` the parser produced for the same literal -
 * `1L == 1.0` is false for `Any?` in kotlin, exactly as
 * `Integer.valueOf(1).equals(Double.valueOf(1))` is in java - and the
 * corpus would fail on a distinction the model does not have.
