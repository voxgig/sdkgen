/**
 * Whole-graph resolution (section 11.4) - a phase, not a discovery.
 *
 * "Activate, and wait in `pending` if you must" is correct and, on its own,
 * produces a terrible experience: apply twenty instances against a registry
 * missing one thing and you get NINETEEN pending rows and no statement of what
 * is actually wrong.
 *
 * `resolveGraph` is a PURE FUNCTION of the registry and the intended
 * activation set. No callbacks run, no state changes, nothing is touched. It
 * answers for the whole graph at once which instances can be live, and for
 * each blocked one THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT that is unmet, and why.
 *
 * The failure mode being designed against is a famous one: OSGi's resolver is
 * correct and its diagnostics are legendarily unusable. A resolver that says
 * "blocked" without saying WHY has moved the problem rather than solved it, so
 * `why` is part of the contract and the corpus pins its shape.
