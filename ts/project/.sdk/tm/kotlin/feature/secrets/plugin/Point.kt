/**
 * Extension points (section 6). Three kinds, chosen because they are what
 * the two existing systems actually needed, and no more.
 *
 * A PLUGIN NEVER MUTATES THE HOST. That inversion is what makes deactivation
 * possible: sdkgen's `utility.fetcher = wrapped` is not undoable, but "this
 * instance holds slot 3 of the request chain" is undoable in O(1). OSGi named
 * it the whiteboard pattern in 2004, in a paper called *Listeners Considered
 * Harmful*, and for exactly this reason.

 * EVERY BINDING IS ARITY TWO, `(next, arg)`, hook and chain alike. `next` is
 * null for a hook. One signature means `Point` does not have to know which
 * kind of point it is holding - and the kind is the HOST's property, not the
 * binding's.
