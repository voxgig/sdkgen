// The corpus test runner: vendored @voxgig/omni driven through its NATIVE
// API (voxgig.omni.Runner.makeRunner / RunPack.runsetflagsargs), presented to
// the corpus drivers in the shape they already use (run.spec, run.set,
// run.runset, run.runsetargs, run.compare). No compatibility shim is
// vendored: the adapter below IS the whole bridge, per language, per the
// vendor-tag rollout (docs/design/vendor-tag-rollout.md, Decision 4).
//
// It supersedes, IN PLACE, the hand-written corpus ENGINE that used to live
// fused inside sdktest/StructCorpus.scala (`object Runner`'s jsonRead,
// fixJson, eqv, matchval, doMatch, resolveArgs, checkResult, handleError and
// runSet). Both corpus drivers keep their file names — StructCorpus.scala
// and PrimaryCorpus.scala — so no emitted call site moved and there is no
// orphan file for `doctor prune` to delete. It is the Scala peer of
// tm/java/test/OmniResolver.java, tm/rust/tests/omni_resolver/mod.rs and
// tm/swift/Tests/ProjectNameSDKTests/OmniResolver.swift.
//
// Lives in the DEFAULT package alongside SdkTestMain / Runner /
// SdkTestSupport, which is where scala-cli's generated test mains live.
//
// Scala-specific decisions, each load-bearing:
//
// 1. TWO VALUE MODELS, ONE CONVERSION PAIR. omni's `Json` is a closed,
//    IMMUTABLE enum (ListMap-backed); this SDK's struct port uses a MUTABLE
//    `Value` ADT (ArrayBuffer / LinkedHashMap). Every crossing is an explicit
//    `tostruct` / `toomni`. `Json.Absent` <-> `Noval` and `Json.Null` <->
//    `VNull` keep apart the two no-value states the corpus distinguishes —
//    which is also why Scala needs neither go's `novalargs` spec rewrite nor
//    lua/php's compat shim for the corpus's ZERO-ARGUMENT entries: an entry
//    with no `in`/`args`/`ctx` arrives from omni as one `Json.Absent`
//    argument and becomes exactly this port's own `Noval`, which is what the
//    retired hand-written `resolveArgs` produced for the same entry.
//
// 2. ARGUMENTS ARE WRITTEN BACK. `SubjectArgs` (List[Json] => (List[Json],
//    Json)) is the channel omni provides for a subject that MUTATES its
//    arguments, which `match: {args: ...}` then asserts on —
//    `struct/minor/setpath` (7 entries) and `struct/merge/integrity` (6) turn
//    on it. Decision 1 handed the subject a CONVERTED COPY, so EVERY subject
//    here runs through `runsetflagsargs` and the wrapper converts the
//    (possibly mutated) `Value` arguments back into omni's own list after the
//    call. A dynamic port's shim gets this free from shared object identity;
//    Scala cannot, because omni's Json has no mutable variant.
//
// 3. `match: {ctx: ...}` IS RETARGETED ONTO `match: {args: {"0": ...}}`.
//    The one place this port cannot follow canonical omni as written, and a
//    VALUE-SEMANTICS consequence, not a choice. omni's `resolveargs` stores
//    `entry.ctx` and `args[0]` as two COPIES of the contextified map, and
//    `checkresult` reads `entry.get("ctx")` for the ctx base — so a subject's
//    post-call writes (decision 2) can never reach the copy `entry.ctx`
//    holds, and eight `primary` entries assert exactly that post-call state.
//    args[0] IS the ctx of a ctx entry (omni itself sets
//    `args = List(entry.get("ctx"))`), so moving the assertion from `ctx` to
//    `args.0` reads the SAME map, post-call, and preserves every leaf:
//    nothing is dropped, weakened or skipped. `retargetctx` below does that
//    rewrite on the spec handed to the engine. Rust and Swift face the
//    identical problem and answer it identically; the upstream fix is for the
//    port's `drive` to re-point `entry.ctx` at the returned `args[0]`, the way
//    JS object identity does implicitly — a follow-up, not a hand-edit of a
//    vendored file.
//
// 4. NUMBERS NEED NOTHING HERE. omni's parser reads every JSON number as
//    Double and this port's `VNum` is also Double. The PRIMARY corpus still
//    narrows an integral Double to a java.lang.Long on its own Java bridge
//    (PrimaryCorpus.toJava) — that is a struct-to-SDK concern, not an
//    omni-to-struct one, and it stays where it was.
//
// 5. KEY ORDER SURVIVES. omni's Scala port models a map as an insertion-
//    ordered `ListMap`, and this port's `VMap` is a `LinkedHashMap`, so the
//    round trip preserves author order. (The Rust port needed a sortedness
//    tripwire because its omni maps are `BTreeMap`; Scala needs none.)
//
// 6. FAILURES ARE ACCUMULATED, NOT RAISED. omni stops a GROUP at its first
//    bad entry and throws an `OmniError`; the corpus mains report the whole
//    corpus in one banner at the end and exit non-zero. `drive` records the
//    message and carries on, so one run still names every broken group.
//
// 7. ABSENCE HAS TWO KINDS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS BENIGN. Every group is
//    looked up as an `OmniGroup`, which keeps the PARENT node beside the
//    group, because the parent is what tells them apart:
//
//      * the whole SECTION is missing — a project corpus that predates it.
//        Fleet-wide this is real and load-bearing: `struct.nullsem` is absent
//        from every project corpus checked (399 of 399), so failing on it
//        would turn the fleet red for a corpus-version skew nobody caused.
//        SKIPPED, and NAMED in the banner.
//
//      * the section IS carried and the GROUP is gone. Nothing legitimate
//        does that: across 691 project corpora, every group these drivers ask
//        for is present and non-empty whenever its section is. It is a corpus
//        regression, so it FAILS. It used to be a skip, and for the four
//        single-node groups `compare` drives it was not even that — `compare`
//        had no guard at all, so deleting `struct/merge/basic`,
//        `struct/inject/basic` or `struct/transform/basic` left a run
//        BIT-IDENTICAL to a healthy one (`PASS 1216  FAIL 0`, exit 0): the
//        absent node became `Noval` on both sides, `fixjson` rendered both as
//        NULLMARK, and NULLMARK deep-equals NULLMARK.
//
// 8. THE PASS COUNT IS WHAT THE ENGINE RAN, NOT WHAT THE CORPUS DECLARES.
//    `drive` counts the times omni invoked the subject wrapper — omni calls
//    it exactly once per entry — and reports THAT. A count read off the spec
//    cannot tell a working engine from a disconnected one: with the
//    `runsetflagsargs` call commented out, the old `report.pass(entrycount)`
//    still printed `PASS 1216  FAIL 0` and exited 0. A number that survives
//    the engine being unplugged is worse than no number, because it reads as
//    evidence. The declared count is kept only as a TRIPWIRE: if the engine
//    ran a different number of entries than the group declares, that
//    mismatch is itself a failure.
