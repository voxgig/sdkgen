/** The JSON value, and the value model this port holds throughout.
  *
  * A `Value` IS A SEALED TRAIT, not `Any`. Scala can express the JSON model
  * exactly, and `Map[String, Any]` would throw away every guarantee the
  * language is for - starting with the one that matters most here, that a
  * pattern match over a sealed hierarchy is CHECKED FOR EXHAUSTIVENESS. Adding
  * a case to this file makes the compiler name every place that has to handle
  * it, which is a stronger discipline than any of the untyped ports can have.
  *
  * `VNum` is a `Double` because JSON HAS ONE NUMBER TYPE. The canonical is
  * javascript, `1` and `1.0` are the same value there, and a port that split
  * them would disagree with the corpus on which of two spellings a document
  * used.
  *
  * NO JSON LIBRARY, AND NO `libraryDependencies` (section 16). The library is
  * allowed exactly one runtime dependency, `voxgig/struct`, which has no scala
  * port; everything else is the standard library.
