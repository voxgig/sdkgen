/** Ordering (section 7) - one rule, one place.
  *
  * sdkgen grew two special cases in `makeOptions` (`test`, then `station`) and
  * the third was not far off. This sort is the whole replacement, and the tiers
  * are in this order for a reason:
  *
  *   1 constraints   before/after edges, by ref or by name
  *   2 bands         integer, lower first, default 0
  *   3 declaration   ties break by `pos`
  *
  * CONSTRAINTS BEAT BANDS precisely so the correct tool wins when both are
  * present. A band expresses a genuine cross-cutting layer; a constraint
  * expresses a relationship between two specific things; and a band chosen by
  * trial and error to fix an ordering bug is a bug wearing a number.
