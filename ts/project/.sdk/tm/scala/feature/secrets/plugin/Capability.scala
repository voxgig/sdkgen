  * on something that can do the job, and which instance is doing it is exactly
  * the configuration detail a plugin must not care about.

  * But A BINDING IS TO AN INSTANCE, not to a capability, which is what decides
  * behaviour when the bound provider leaves while another match remains.

    * band, because bands live on POINT BINDINGS: a provider may have several
    * bindings with different bands, or none at all, so a rank reaching for one
    * would be undefined in the common case.
    *
    * Without a total rank, "any provider satisfies" is true of the GRAPH and
    * useless to the PLUGIN - two ports could bind different `store` instances,
    * both resolve green, and behave differently, which is precisely the
