/** Extension points (section 6). Three kinds, chosen because they are what the
  * two existing systems actually needed, and no more.
  *
  * A PLUGIN NEVER MUTATES THE HOST. That inversion is what makes deactivation
  * possible: sdkgen's `utility.fetcher = wrapped` is not undoable, but "this
  * instance holds slot 3 of the request chain" is undoable in O(1). OSGi named
  * it the whiteboard pattern in 2004, in a paper called *Listeners Considered
  * Harmful*, and for exactly this reason.

  * kind of point it is holding - and the kind is the HOST's property, not the
  * binding's.

    * unsaid gets four different answers from four ports, in the concurrency
    * behaviour of production code no corpus entry happens to cover.

    * make every hook point a scheduling decision and every ordering assertion a
