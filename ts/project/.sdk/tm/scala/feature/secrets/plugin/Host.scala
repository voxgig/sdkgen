/** The host: the lifecycle state machine (section 5), extension points
  * (section 6), and resource capture (section 8) - and the definition and
  * instance types the callbacks see.
  *
  * TWO RULES SHAPE EVERY METHOD BELOW.
  *
  * Transitions are SEQUENTIAL (section 5.2). One at a time, in call order,
  * never interleaved; a transition triggered from inside a lifecycle callback
  * is `plugin_reentrant`. A hard rule, because it is the only way the semantics
  * can be identical in Go, in Ruby and in single-threaded JavaScript.
  *
  * Reconciliation is EAGER (section 18's portability budget). A transition
  * settles by running the state machine to a fixed point, not by suspending on
  * a promise. NOTHING HERE RETURNS A `Future`, and that is the decision scala
  * most invites you to get wrong: a `Future`-returning transition would make
  * section 5.2's "one at a time, in call order" a claim about an
  * `ExecutionContext` rather than about the code.
  *
  * THE HOST AND ITS ENTRIES ARE MUTABLE, and nothing else in the port is. Every
  * value here is immutable and every `Value` is a case class; these two classes
  * are the state machine, and threading a rebuilt registry through every method
  * would make a callback's writes land in a copy nobody reads back.
  */

/** A plugin definition. A CASE CLASS WITH NAMED CALLBACKS, not a `Value` map:
  * scala cannot hold a function in the sealed JSON hierarchy, and pretending
  * otherwise would mean a `VOpaque` per callback and a cast at every call. The
  * shape every port has - a name, four lifecycle callbacks, `reconfigure` and
  * an option shape - is written in the type system rather than in a comment.
