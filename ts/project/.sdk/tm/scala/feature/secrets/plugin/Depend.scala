/** Dependency cardinality, policy, and the restart graph (section 11.3).
  *
  * TWO AXES, BOTH DECLARED BY THE DEFINITION THAT HAS THE REQUIREMENT, because
  * only it knows what it can cope with:
  *
  *                | static (default)          | dynamic
  *   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
  *   mandatory    | unmet -> pending;         | unmet -> pending;
  *   (default)    | lost  -> pending,         | lost  -> STAYS LIVE,
  *                |          recursively      |          notified
  *   -------------|---------------------------|--------------------------
  *   optional:true| never gates activation;   | never gates activation;
  *                | a change deactivates and  | a change is a
  *                | reactivates               | notification, nothing else
  *
  * `dynamic` means the plugin has said, IN WRITING, that it can survive its
  * provider being swapped underneath it. It is not the default because most
  * plugins cannot, and the cost of wrongly assuming they can is a live instance
  * holding a dead reference.
  *
  * The rebinding-preference axis is deliberately omitted. OSGi has reluctant vs
  * greedy and it is a knob every author must understand to read anyone else's
  * component; we take always-reluctant. Three axes were more than the model can
  * carry across twenty ports.

    * all at the instance level.
