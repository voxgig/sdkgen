  "The declarative document (section 9): normalization, and the ten-level
  precedence ladder.

  TWO FUNCTIONS, AND THE SPLIT BETWEEN THEM IS FORCED.

  `normalize-config` normalizes STRUCTURE and ENTRY KEYS. It does not
  merge options, and cannot: section 9.4 makes merge behaviour a property
  of the definition's option SHAPE, which normalization has never seen. A
  normalizer that flattened the option layers would make `$MERGE: append`
  unimplementable at load time, because the layers it must concatenate
  would already be collapsed.

  `resolve-options` applies the ladder, and it is the only place that
  knows the shape."
