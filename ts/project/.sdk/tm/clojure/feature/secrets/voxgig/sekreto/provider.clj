;; A source of secrets.
;;
;; A provider answers one question: "do you have this secret?" It returns
;; the value, or nil to mean "ask the next one". Nothing else about a
;; provider is visible to the caller - which is the point: an app reads
;; `api.token` and never learns whether it came from the environment, a
;; .env file, HashiCorp Vault or a boru vault.
;;
;; A protocol rather than a map of functions: a provider of your own is any
;; type that satisfies it, and `satisfies?` can say so before a chain is
;; built.

    "A short description, shown by `sources`. It opens with the provider's
    kind, because that is what a store's default name is taken from."))
