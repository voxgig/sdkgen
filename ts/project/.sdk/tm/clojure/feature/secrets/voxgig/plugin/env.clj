  "Environment overrides (section 9.5) - level 7 of the ladder.

  One prefix, so nothing drifts: `VOXGIG_PLUGIN_*`.

    VOXGIG_PLUGIN_PROFILE            the profile name
    VOXGIG_PLUGIN_<REF>_<PATH>       one option
    VOXGIG_PLUGIN_ACTIVE/INACTIVE    comma-separated refs, INACTIVE wins

  THE ENCODING IS LOSSY, AND THIS SAYS SO RATHER THAN PRETENDING
  OTHERWISE. Ref and path are upper-snake with `$` -> `__` and `.` -> `_`.
  But `_` is legal in a name and in a tag, and the mapping folds case, so
  `retry$fast` and `retry__fast` both encode to `RETRY__FAST`.

  Rather than restrict a grammar the rest of the stack already uses, the
  host DETECTS THE COLLISION: it encodes every ref it holds, and a key two
  refs claim is `plugin_env_ambiguous`, naming both."
