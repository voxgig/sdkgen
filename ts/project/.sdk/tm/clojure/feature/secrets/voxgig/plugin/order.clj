  "Ordering (section 7) - one rule, one place.

  sdkgen grew two special cases in `makeOptions` (`test`, then `station`)
  and the third was not far off. This sort is the whole replacement, and
  the tiers are in this order for a reason:

    1 constraints   before/after edges, by ref or by name
    2 bands         integer, lower first, default 0
    3 declaration   ties break by `pos`

  CONSTRAINTS BEAT BANDS precisely so the correct tool wins when both are
  present. A band expresses a genuine cross-cutting layer; a constraint
  expresses a relationship between two specific things; and a band chosen
  by trial and error to fix an ordering bug is a bug wearing a number."
