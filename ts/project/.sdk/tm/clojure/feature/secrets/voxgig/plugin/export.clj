  "Exports (section 11).

  An instance publishes values for other plugins and for the application.
  Read with `(host/exports h \"retry$fast/client\")`.

  THE UNQUALIFIED ALIAS IS THE INTERESTING PART. `retry/client` resolves
  to the UNTAGGED instance if one exists; if not, and exactly one tagged
  instance exports that key, it resolves to that one; if two do, it is
  `plugin_export_ambiguous` - deliberately diverging from seneca's silent
  last-wins, because with multi-instance as a headline feature an
  ambiguous alias is a defect waiting for production."
