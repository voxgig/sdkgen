  "Dynamic resolution (section 10.2) - name to candidate module ids.

  PURE. It returns the ids a host WOULD try, in order; it does not load
  anything. That separation is what lets the corpus pin resolution in
  every language including those with no dynamic loading at all, and it is
  why section 15.4 puts real module loading in per-port integration tests
  rather than here."

  name with a letter or `@`, so `./local/thing` is not a ref and never

  goes, and this design deliberately does not, because a ref is an ADDRESS
  WITHIN A HOST and a path is a LOCATION ON A DISK."
