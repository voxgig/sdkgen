;; FEATURE SUITES THAT SHIP AS THEIR OWN FILE.
;;
;; A feature whose source ships as its own gated container brings its own
;; suite with it, at sdk/test/feature/<name>.clj. An SDK that did not
;; select the feature has neither file, and most features have no separate
;; suite at all - so the require has to be conditional.
;;
;; IT IS CONDITIONAL ON THE FILES THAT SHIPPED, read off the classpath, and
;; on nothing else. Keying it off the generated wiring instead (sdk.config's
;; feature-extra, or its `feature` map) looks tidier and is a trap: break
;; the wiring and the suite that would have caught it is skipped IN
;; SILENCE, so an SDK sending unauthenticated requests still reports ALL
;; GREEN. With the file as the gate, a shipped suite ALWAYS runs, and a
;; suite that will not load or has no `run` is a recorded FAILURE rather
;; than a skip.

;; prints, and the line sdkgen's own lane REQUIRES
;; (ts/test/generatedcompile.test.ts, `clojure: the secrets feature runs
;; with the feature active`). Exit zero is not evidence: drop the
;; `(run-feature-suites rec)` call from -main and every check below simply
;; vanishes from the SDK count with ALL GREEN still printed, which is how
;; the secrets suite was once disconnected without a single red. The count
;; is of checks that EXECUTED (one rec per sdk.testutil/run-check), never a
;; declared size, so a stopped engine cannot reproduce it; and a suite that
;; loads, runs and records nothing is a FAILURE, not a pass.
