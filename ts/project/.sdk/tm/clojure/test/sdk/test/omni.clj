;; ProjectName SDK corpus test runner: the vendored @voxgig/omni engine driven
;; through its NATIVE API (`voxgig.omni.runner/make-runner`), presented to the
;; corpus suites in the runner shape they already use (`:spec`, `:runset`,
;; `:runsetflags`, `:client`). No compatibility shim is vendored: the adapter
;; below IS the whole bridge, per language, per the vendor-tag rollout
;; (docs/design/vendor-tag-rollout.md, Decision 4). It is the clojure peer of
;; tm/lua/test/omni.lua, tm/rb/test/omni.rb and tm/java/test/OmniResolver.java.
;;
;; Four local decisions, all required:
;;
;; 1. TWO VALUE MODELS, converted at the subject boundary. omni's clojure port
;;    speaks IMMUTABLE clojure data - `ismap` is `map?`, `islist` is `vector?`,
;;    absence is the `::u/absent` keyword. The SDK and the vendored struct
;;    speak MUTABLE JVM collections (java.util.LinkedHashMap / ArrayList),
;;    because struct's contract is that a utility MUTATES the node it is
;;    given. Neither recognises the other, so `wrap-subject` converts every
;;    argument on the way in (`->struct`) and the result on the way out
;;    (`->omni`).
;;
;; 2. NO-VALUE ARITY (the zero-argument correction the dynamic ports carry).
;;    An entry with no `in` must reach the subject as NO value, not as one
;;    null: the corpus has both `{in: null, out: <T_null>}` and
;;    `{out: <T_noval>}`, and a port that collapses them silently passes one
;;    of the two. omni models the absence as its ABSENT sentinel, and here it
;;    becomes a genuine ZERO-ARITY call whenever the subject HAS a zero-arity
;;    arm - `s/typify` is handed to the corpus bare, so `(typify)` answers
;;    T_noval where `(typify nil)` answers T_null.
;;
;;    A subject with no zero-arity arm gets `nil` instead. That fallback is
;;    not a convenience: struct's NOARG is TYPIFY's marker, not a general
;;    no-value, so handing it to a one-arity subject is simply a wrong
;;    argument - `(isempty NOARG)` answers false where the corpus wants the
;;    true that `(isempty nil)` gives, and `(clone NOARG)` answers a sentinel
;;    where it wants null. The corpus caught both. It is also the LIVE path
;;    for `minor.stringify` and `minor.pathify`: their corpus subjects are
;;    one-arity wrappers, so they take the nil and make struct's own no-arg
;;    call themselves.
;;
;;    Which arm a subject has is READ OFF THE FUNCTION (`accepts-no-args?`),
;;    never discovered by calling it and catching ArityException - see the
;;    note on that function.
;;
;; 2a. WHAT RAN IS COUNTED, not what the corpus declared. A section's pass
;;    count comes from `subject-calls`, incremented inside the subject
;;    wrapper - the one place only the engine can reach - and `runsetflags`
;;    returns the delta across the set. A count taken from the section's own
;;    `set` prints the same number whether the engine ran or was never
;;    called, which makes it evidence of nothing.
;;
;; 3. THE CTX CHANNEL (`live-map`). omni snapshots `entry.ctx` BEFORE calling
;;    the subject, then matches against that snapshot afterwards. In every
;;    mutable-language port the snapshot and the argument are the same live
;;    object, so a utility that writes `ctx.spec.headers.authorization` is
;;    visible to `match: {ctx: ...}` (9 primary entries turn on exactly that).
;;    Clojure's data is immutable, so the snapshot would freeze the
;;    pre-call state and every such assertion would read null. `contextify`
;;    therefore hands omni a LIVE VIEW: a type that satisfies `map?` (so
;;    `u/ismap`, `u/getpath`, `u/deepequal` and `u/stringify` all accept it)
;;    but reads through to the mutable map the subject actually mutates. The
;;    port's own `:runsetflags-args` channel carries the ARGUMENT writeback;
;;    this carries the ctx one, which `runsetflags-args` cannot reach.
;;
;; 4. LIVE OBJECTS CROSS BY REFERENCE. A value that belongs to neither model -
;;    the provider, an SDK client, a Context atom - passes through the
;;    converters as a leaf, so subjects keep real object identity (and so a
;;    cyclic SDK object is never walked).

;; documents `number -> Double`. On most ports that is invisible, because
;; their struct has one numeric type. Clojure's does not: `typify` answers

;; "decimal" - not because the SDK is wrong, but because the spec was

;;

;; renders 5.0 as 5), so nothing downstream notices.
