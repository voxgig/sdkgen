;; ProjectName SDK secrets feature behaviour tests.
;;
;; The contract under test: the `apikey` OPTION keeps its exact old meaning
;; and always wins, because the feature places it FIRST in the provider
;; chain (a `memory` store named `options`) - explicit-beats-lookup falls
;; out of sekreto's first-hit rule rather than from special-case logic.
;; With the feature inactive nothing changes at all. With it active and the
;; option unset, the chain supplies the credential instead. A provider MISS
;; falls through unauthenticated; a provider ERROR FAILS the operation.
;;
;; EVERY CASE HERE BUILDS A LIVE CLIENT (client/make-sdk with
;; `system.fetch`), never client/test-sdk and never the sdk.test.feature
;; harness. Both of those replace `ctx.utility.fetcher` with an in-memory
;; mock, so a counter hung off system.fetch is NEVER REACHED - under a test
;; client both "no request was sent" and "the call failed" hold for a
;; healthy SDK carrying no secrets feature at all, and the pair asserts
;; nothing. An assertion that cannot fail pins no rule.
;;
;; So each fail-closed case proves its own counter FIRST, with the same
;; construction and a WORKING provider: one request must reach system.fetch
;; carrying the resolved credential. Only then does a zero from the broken
;; provider mean REFUSED rather than UNWIRED. And the failure is matched on
;; THE PROVIDER'S OWN MESSAGE, so an unrelated failure (a missing route, a
;; blocked op) cannot stand in for fail-closed.
;;
;; This file lives in the `feature/` container of the test tree on purpose:
;; it is generated only for a project whose model selects `secrets`, and
;; sdk.test-runner reaches it through the same sdk.config wiring the
;; feature itself is registered by.
