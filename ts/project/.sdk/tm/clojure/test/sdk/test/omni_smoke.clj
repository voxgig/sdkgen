;; Smoke tests for the VENDORED omni runner itself: a runner that cannot FAIL a
;; bad entry would turn every corpus suite vacuously green, so the failure
;; paths are pinned here, not just the happy one. (Clojure peer of lua's
;; test/omni_smoke_test.lua and ts's test/omni.test.ts.)

;; A minimal in-memory spec: no fixture file, no OMNI block (lenient v0, like
