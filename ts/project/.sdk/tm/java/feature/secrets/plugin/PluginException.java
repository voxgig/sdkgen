/**
 * Every error carries a §12 code. Ports compare by CODE and never by
 * message: wording is a port's own business, and pinning the words would
 * make every translation a corpus change. The FORMAT, however, is pinned -
 * a parseable message is what makes a log searchable across twenty
 * languages.
 *
 * <p>UNCHECKED, deliberately. A checked exception would put {@code throws}
 * on every lifecycle callback signature in every plugin ever written, and
 * §19's budget is a library that stays small for the people embedding it.
