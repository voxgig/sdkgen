# ProjectName SDK corpus test runner: the vendored @voxgig/omni engine driven
# through its NATIVE API (`Voxgig.Omni.Runner.make_runner/2`), presented to the
# corpus suites in the runner shape they already use (`:spec`, `:runset`,
# `:runsetflags`, `:client`). No compatibility shim is vendored: the adapter
# below IS the whole bridge, per language, per the vendor-tag rollout
# (docs/design/vendor-tag-rollout.md, Decision 4). It is the Elixir peer of
# tm/lua/test/omni.lua, tm/rb/test/omni.rb, tm/clojure/test/sdk/test/omni.clj
# and tm/swift/Tests/ProjectNameSDKTests/OmniResolver.swift.
#
# Five local decisions, each load-bearing:
#
# 1. TWO VALUE MODELS, converted at the subject boundary. omni's Elixir port
#    speaks IMMUTABLE native data - `ismap` is `is_map/1` minus structs,
#    `islist` is `is_list/1`, absence is the `:"$omni_absent"` atom. The SDK
#    and its vendored struct speak a MUTABLE ETS HEAP, because struct's
#    contract is that a utility MUTATES the node it is given: a node there is
#    a tagged handle - `{:vmap, id}` / `{:vlist, id}` - which is a TUPLE, so
#    omni's own predicates read every SDK node as an opaque leaf and its
#    walkers never descend into one. Neither model recognises the other, so
#    `wrapsubject` converts every argument on the way in (`tostruct`) and the
#    result on the way out (`toomni`).
#
# 2. ARGUMENT WRITEBACK VIA `runsetflags_args`. 13 struct entries assert an
#    IN-PLACE rewrite of the argument - `minor/setpath` in all 7 and
#    `merge/integrity` in all 6. The subject mutates the HEAP COPY that
#    decision 1 built, which the immutable list omni holds can never see. The
#    port carries a second entry point for exactly this (`runsetflags_args`:
#    the subject returns `{args, result}` and `checkresult` builds the `args`
#    base from what came back), so every subject goes through it and hands its
#    post-call arguments back. omni-rust, omni-cpp, omni-ocaml and omni-swift
#    use the same channel for the same reason.
#
# 3. `match: {ctx: ...}` IS RETARGETED ONTO `match: {args: {"0": ...}}`.
#    Nine primary entries assert on context state the utility WROTE, and
#    `checkresult` reads that base from `entry.ctx` - which `resolveargs`
#    froze BEFORE the subject ran. In a mutable-object port the frozen
#    reference and the live context are the same thing; on the BEAM they are
#    two values, so every such assertion would read the pre-call state. omni's
#    own args channel (decision 2) is the post-call view, and args[0] IS the
#    ctx of a ctx entry - omni itself sets `args = [entry.ctx]` - so moving
#    the assertion from `ctx` to `args.0` reads the SAME map, post-call, and
#    preserves every leaf. `retargetctx/1` does that rewrite on the spec
#    handed to the engine; nothing is dropped, weakened or skipped. This is
#    the Swift port's decision 3, for the identical value-semantics reason;
#    the upstream fix is for `run_entry` to re-point `entry["ctx"]` at the
#    returned `callargs` head, filed as a follow-up rather than worked around
#    by editing a vendored file.
#
# 4. NO-VALUE ARITY. An entry carrying none of `in`/`args`/`ctx` must reach
#    the subject as NO value, not as one null: the corpus has both
#    `{in: null, out: <T_null>}` and `{out: <T_noval>}`, and a port that
#    collapses them silently passes one of the two. omni models the absence
#    as its ABSENT sentinel; `trimabsent/1` drops trailing absents so the
#    subject receives an EMPTY argument list, which is what the corpus
#    subjects already branch on (`typify()` answers T_noval where
#    `typify(nil)` answers T_null, and `stringify/0` and `pathify/0` carry the
#    same no-arg arity).
#
# 5. NIL ON THE WAY OUT IS ABSENT. Elixir has one `nil` where the canonical
#    port has `undefined` and `null`, so a subject that returns NOTHING and
#    one that returns JSON null are indistinguishable here (the struct port
#    says so in its own header: "the canonical `undefined` and JSON `null` are
#    both `nil`"). Only the `{null: false}` groups can tell, and there the
#    corpus is lopsided: reading a top-level `nil` as ABSENT costs 4 entries
#    (named and guarded in struct_corpus_test.exs), reading it as null costs
#    43. So a TOP-LEVEL nil result becomes ABSENT; a nil stored INSIDE a
#    returned node stays a JSON null, because struct's `setprop` genuinely
#    stores it and `keysof` genuinely reports the key.
#
# The live SDK crosses both converters BY REFERENCE: a struct heap handle is a
# tuple and the provider carries `@livekey`, so neither is ever rebuilt as
# corpus data and no cyclic SDK object is ever walked.
