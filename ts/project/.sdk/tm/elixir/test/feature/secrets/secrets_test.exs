# Behavioural tests for the secrets feature (vendored @voxgig/sekreto).
#
# The contract under test: the `apikey` OPTION keeps its exact old meaning
# and always wins, because ProjectName.Feature.Secrets places it FIRST in the
# provider chain (a `memory` store named `options`) - explicit-beats-lookup
# falls out of sekreto's first-hit rule rather than from special-case logic.
# With the feature inactive nothing changes at all. With it active and the
# option unset, the chain (env, dotenv, a custom provider, a vault) supplies
# the credential instead.
#
# EVERY CASE BUILDS A LIVE CLIENT WITH A RECORDING `system.fetch`, and asserts
# on what that recorder saw. That is not incidental - it is the whole point.
# This feature resolves at the TRANSPORT SEAM (see the header of
# feature/secrets.ex), so `prepare/2` returns before any lookup has happened
# and a header assertion taken there would pass for an SDK with no secrets
# feature at all. And ProjectName.test/2 REPLACES the fetcher with the test
# feature's in-memory mock, so a counter hung off `system.fetch` is never
# reached under it: "no request was sent" and "the request failed" would both
# hold for a healthy SDK, and the pair would assert nothing. An assertion that
# cannot fail pins no rule.
#
# So each fail-closed case proves its own counter FIRST, with the same
# construction and a WORKING provider: one request must reach `system.fetch`
# carrying the resolved credential. Only then does a zero from the broken
# provider mean REFUSED rather than UNWIRED. And the failure is matched on the
# PROVIDER'S OWN message, so an unrelated failure (a missing route, a blocked
# op) cannot stand in for fail-closed.
#
# This file lives in the `feature/` container on purpose: `target add` trims
# it, along with the feature source and the vendored library, for a project
# whose model does not select `secrets`.
