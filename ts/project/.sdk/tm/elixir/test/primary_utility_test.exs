# ProjectName SDK primary-utility test
#
# Drives the SHARED language-neutral corpus (.sdk/test/test.json -> "primary")
# through this SDK's request-shaping utilities, so the cases cannot drift from
# the reference implementation. Each section is looked up with getSpec and
# executed with runset, as the ts/js reference harness does.
#
# This suite used to MIRROR the corpus by hand: it asserted a handful of
# behaviours it had transcribed, so a corpus case that changed — or one that
# was added — went unnoticed here. Driving the corpus is what makes elixir a
# FULL parity target rather than a mirrored one.
