# ProjectName SDK omni runner smoke test
#
# Smoke tests for the VENDORED omni runner itself. A runner that cannot FAIL
# a bad entry would turn every corpus suite vacuously green, so the failure
# paths are pinned here, not just the happy one. (Elixir peer of ts's
# test/omni.test.ts, lua's test/omni_smoke_test.lua and py's
# test_omni_smoke.py.)
#
# The spec is built IN MEMORY, in omni's own value model (plain maps and
# lists, no OMNI block - the lenient v0 format the shared corpus uses), so
# these tests depend on no fixture file.
