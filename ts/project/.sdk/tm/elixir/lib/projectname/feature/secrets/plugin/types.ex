  @moduledoc """
  Shared types and the value helpers every module reads data through.

  Deliberately small: the design's section 19 budget says the library owns
  naming, configuration, lifecycle, ordering, binding and teardown, and
  nothing else.

  ELIXIR IS THE FIRST PORT THAT NEEDS NO TRICKS FOR THE VALUE MODEL, and
  it is worth saying which tricks it does without:

    * `%{}` and `[]` are DIFFERENT TYPES, so the empty-map-versus-empty-list
      distinction php cannot draw and lua needs tagged tables for is free
      here.
    * A map holds `nil`, so `Map.has_key?` separates ABSENT from
      present-and-null with no sentinel - perl and lua both carry one.
    * `1 == 1.0` is true and `true == 1`, `"1" == 1` are both false, which
      is exactly JSON's one number type plus JSON's type-strict equality.
      php, perl and lua each need a guard for that; ruby, rust, java and
      this port do not.

  What it does NOT give free is mutation, and `Voxgig.Plugin.Host` says
  what that cost.

  A STABLE sort by a key function.

  Stability is load-bearing, not tidiness: the canonical's comparators fall
  through to a `pos` or ref tie-break that javascript's stable sort then
  resolves by POSITION, and a port that shuffled equal keys would order a
  teardown differently between two runs of the same process. Replacing this
  with an unstable sort fails `order/order/seqtie`.

  `Enum.sort_by/2` is already that sort. Its documented promise is
  conditional - `Enum.sort/2` is "stable as long as the given function
  returns true for equal terms" - and the `<=` comparator `sort_by/2`
  builds from a key function is exactly one that does. THE NAME IS WHAT
  THIS FUNCTION IS FOR: every sort in the port goes through one place that
  says stability is required, so the next reader does not have to re-derive
  that conditional from the docs.

  JSON equality: same type, then same value.

  Map and list comparison is structural and key order does not matter,
