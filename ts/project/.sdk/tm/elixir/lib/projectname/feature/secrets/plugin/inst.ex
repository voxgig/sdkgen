defmodule Voxgig.Plugin.Inst do
  @moduledoc """
  What a definition's callbacks see. Deliberately not the internal record:
  a plugin that could reach `status` could also write it.

  THE INSTANCE IS A HANDLE, NOT A COPY - `%Inst{host:, ref:}` and nothing
  else. Every accessor reads the entry back out of the host, so a callback
  always sees current values and there is no snapshot to keep in sync.
  That is the whole of this port's answer to the canonical's "REFILL
  rather than REBIND" (section 9.6): the canonical must empty and refill
  the options map because a definition closes over the object it was
  handed at `define`; here there is no such object, so `apply` simply
  replaces the entry's options and the next `options/1` reads them.

  must not make teardown wrong.
