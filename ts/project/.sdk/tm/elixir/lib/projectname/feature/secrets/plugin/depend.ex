  Dependency cardinality, policy, and the restart graph (section 11.3).

  TWO AXES, BOTH DECLARED BY THE DEFINITION THAT HAS THE REQUIREMENT,
  because only it knows what it can cope with: a mandatory-static
  requirement gates activation and restarts on loss; a mandatory-dynamic
  one gates but survives a swap; an optional-static one never gates but
  restarts on a change; an optional-dynamic one is a notification and
  nothing else.

  `dynamic` means the plugin has said, IN WRITING, that it can survive its
  provider being swapped underneath it. It is not the default because most
  plugins cannot, and the cost of wrongly assuming they can is a live
  instance holding a dead reference.

  A cycle through restart-causing requirements is
  `plugin_dependency_cycle`, detected AT LOAD - before anything runs,

  only safe time to report that is before it starts.

  The graph is over capabilities, not refs: an edge runs from a consumer to
  EVERY node that provides what it needs, because any of them could be the
  one selected and a cycle through any is a cycle. A node also satisfies
  its own name as a ref (section 11.1), which is why the ref is a provider
  of itself here.
