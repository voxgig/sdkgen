  Extension points (section 6). Three kinds, chosen because they are what
  the two existing systems actually needed, and no more.

  A PLUGIN NEVER MUTATES THE HOST. That inversion is what makes
  deactivation possible: sdkgen's `utility.fetcher = wrapped` is not
  undoable, but "this instance holds slot 3 of the request chain" is
  undoable in O(1). OSGi named it the whiteboard pattern in 2004, in a
  paper called *Listeners Considered Harmful*, and for exactly this reason.

  Section 6.1: "fan-out" is not one answer but four. In a language with
  asynchrony, "call every binding" hides a decision - start them all and
  wait, await each in turn, or do not wait - and a design that leaves it
  unsaid gets four different answers from four ports, in the concurrency
  behaviour of production code no corpus entry happens to cover.

  ELIXIR IS THE PORT WHERE THAT IS LOUDEST: `Task.async_stream` is right
  there, and using it for `emit` would make every hook point concurrent and
  every ordering assertion a race. The host stays sequential (section 5.2)
  and the modes stay data.
