defmodule Voxgig.Plugin do
  @moduledoc """
  The canonical surface `make parity` checks (AGENTS.md section 4). Small
  on purpose (section 19): everything else is functions on `Host` and
  `Inst`, because a library that grows a second public entry point per
  feature is a library twenty ports pay for twice.

  ELEVEN NAMES, AND THEY ARE DELEGATIONS RATHER THAN DEFINITIONS. The
  implementation lives in the module named for its design section, so a
  reader who arrives at `resolve_order/2` from the corpus lands in
  `Voxgig.Plugin.Order` where section 7 is quoted, not in a facade that
  forwards.
