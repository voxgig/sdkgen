  Exports (section 11).

  An instance publishes values for other plugins and for the application.

  THE UNQUALIFIED ALIAS IS THE INTERESTING PART. `retry/client` resolves to
  the UNTAGGED instance if one exists; if not, and exactly one tagged
  instance exports that key, it resolves to that one; if two do, it is
  `plugin_export_ambiguous` - deliberately diverging from seneca's silent
  last-wins, because with multi-instance as a headline feature an ambiguous
  alias is a defect waiting for production.

  `exported` is a list of `%{ref:, key:, value:}` - an internal shape,
  never a corpus value, so it uses atom keys where the data does not.
