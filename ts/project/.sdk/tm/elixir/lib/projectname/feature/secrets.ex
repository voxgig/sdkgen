# ProjectName SDK secrets feature
#
# Secret access via a vendored @voxgig/sekreto provider chain, and the
# access-token exchange some APIs require on top of it. The elixir port of
# tm/ts/src/feature/secrets/SecretsFeature.ts - same contract, elixir idiom,
# and the same structural choices go made (see tm/go/feature/secrets_feature.go).
#
# The SDK's `apikey` option keeps exactly its old meaning: an explicit
# credential given in code. This feature makes it ONE SOURCE among several
# rather than the only one: when active, the apikey is resolved through a
# sekreto chain in which the explicit option (when set) is the FIRST
# provider - a `memory` store named `options` - so an explicit value always
# wins, by sekreto's own first-hit rule rather than by special-case logic.
# When the option is unset the remaining providers (env, dotenv, a vault)
# are asked in order, and moving a credential from code to a vault becomes
# a configuration change.
#
# WHERE THE CREDENTIAL LIVES: in FEATURE STATE, never in the shared options
# map. This is go's structural deviation from the ts reference (which writes
# options.apikey), and elixir needs it for two reasons of its own. The
# options node is the client's single live struct node, read raw by every
# concurrent operation, so a feature that mutated it would race them; and
# `prepare_auth` reads a CLONE of it (`opts_map/1`), so the write would in
# any case have to land before the clone was taken, which the async chain
# cannot promise. The header the wire sees is identical, because the
# transport wrapper below rebuilds it exactly as prepare_auth does.
#
# WHERE RESOLUTION HAPPENS: at the TRANSPORT SEAM, for the same reason go
# resolves there. `direct/2` and `graphql/4` run NO feature hooks at all -
# Main.fragment.ex's `raw_request/2` builds its own ctx and calls
# `Utility.fetcher/3` directly - so a lookup that lived only in a PreSpec
# hook would leave both raw paths sending unauthenticated requests and
# never notice. The fetcher slot on the shared utility node is the ONE
# place every wire path crosses (retry.ex uses the same seam), and it is
# late-bound through `Utility.fetcher/3`, so wrapping it at init is seen by
# every holder.
#
# MISS vs ERROR (sekreto's invariant): a provider MISS falls through - the
# op proceeds, unauthenticated if nothing else supplies a credential. A
# provider ERROR (unreachable vault, bad credentials) must FAIL the op: a
# broken vault never degrades into an unauthenticated request. sekreto
# signals an error by RAISING `Sekreto.Error` and a miss by answering nil,
# so every call into the chain is wrapped here and a raise becomes the
# seam's `{nil, err}` - which is how a wrapper refuses a request. Nothing
# from sekreto is ever allowed to escape as a raise: the pipeline's
# tolerance for those is uneven (retry.ex re-raises, the raw path rescues
# only around `prepare`), and a vault outage must be a clean SDK error
# rather than a crash.
#
# EXCHANGE: some APIs will not take a long-lived credential at all. What
# the chain resolves is then a REFRESH token, which buys a short-lived
# ACCESS token from a token endpoint (`exchange.path`, relative to
# options.base); the access token is what every request carries, and when a
# response status in `exchange.statuses` (401) says it is spent the wrapper
# buys another and retries the same request once. Test mode buys nothing
# and answers with a deterministic fake token.
#
# CONCURRENCY is weaker than go's, deliberately. There is no mutex idiom
# here, and the obvious substitute - an Agent for single-flight resolution -
# would reintroduce exactly the lifetime hazard documented below. The
# resolved credential is held on the feature's own ETS-backed struct node,
# so individual reads and writes are atomic and a lost update is benign
# (both values are valid credentials); two concurrent FIRST resolutions may
# each ask the chain, and sekreto's own read cache absorbs that from the
# second hit onwards. Stated rather than discovered later.
#
# THE DEAD CELL. `Sekreto.Cell.new/1` is `Agent.start_link`, so the chain's
# state process is LINKED to whichever process built the client. A client
# constructed in a process that later exits ABNORMALLY leaves a dead Agent,
# and every later lookup exits `{:noproc, {GenServer, :call, ...}}` rather
# than raising. That is the sekreto peer of the ETS-heap staleness the
# generated Config module already guards with `usable?/1`, and it is
# handled the same way: the exit is caught, the chain is rebuilt ONCE from
# the specs init kept, and the lookup is retried. A rebuild cannot swallow
# a genuine provider error, because a provider error RAISES and never
# exits. The real fix is `Agent.start` upstream.
