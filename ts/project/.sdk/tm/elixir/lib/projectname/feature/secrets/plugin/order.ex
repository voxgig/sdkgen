  Ordering (section 7) - one rule, one place.

  sdkgen grew two special cases in `makeOptions` (`test`, then `station`)
  and the third was not far off. This sort is the whole replacement, and
  the tiers are in this order for a reason:

    1 constraints   before/after edges, by ref or by name
    2 bands         integer, lower first, default 0
    3 declaration   ties break by `pos`

  CONSTRAINTS BEAT BANDS precisely so the correct tool wins when both are
  present. A band expresses a genuine cross-cutting layer; a constraint
  expresses a relationship between two specific things; and a band chosen
  by trial and error to fix an ordering bug is a bug wearing a number.

  A PIN IS NOT A CONSTRAINT (section 7).

  Constraints and bands are negotiable by definition - they are what
  plugins and documents say they want, and the sort's job is to satisfy
  them all. A pin is the host stating a structural invariant of its own
  architecture, which is a different kind of claim and must not lose a tie
  to a document.

  So a pin PLACES the binding at the named end, and an ordering that would
  move it away is `plugin_order_pinned` - rejected, not honoured into a
  broken wrap.
