// The secrets feature's public surface (feature/secrets.c). A header of its
// own, unlike the other c features, because callers need more than the
// constructor sdk.h's list gives every bundled feature: the LIVE sekreto
// instance (arbitrary secrets, redaction), the resolved credential, and
// the init-failure text - the c spelling of ts's `sdk.secrets().sekreto()`
// and go's `Sekreto()` / `Credential()` accessors. Named for the feature so
// the feature trim drops it with feature/secrets.c and feature/secrets/.
//
// The feature is GATED (model/feature/secrets.aon `needs: { sekreto: true }`
// and model/target/c.aon `provides`), so its constructor is NOT in sdk.h's
// bundled list: core/config.c emits the prototype for a project that
// selected it, and this header repeats it for a caller that includes only
// this file.
