// Station self-registration (voxgig/station design §6.2, path 1): linking
// this package is the whole bootstrap. When the station library is
// installed beside this SDK, the {construct, config} factory pair is
// registered under the api slug (config.main.slug, the descriptor slug) at
// module init, so `station.sdk('<name>')` needs no imports in application
// code. Registration is SOFT — the station library is a peer dependency of
// the station feature, and a project without it skips registration and
// gets exactly the SDK it always had. Only a genuine module-not-found is
// swallowed: a station that RESOLVES but throws while loading must
// propagate (a silently empty factory table has no visible cause), and so
// must station_factory_conflict — two different builds of one SDK in one
// process is not a thing to pick between quietly.
