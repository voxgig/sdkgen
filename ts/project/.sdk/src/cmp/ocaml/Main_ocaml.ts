  // directories would not build), the -I paths, unix.cma for the dotenv

  // group declares `needs.fetch`, the OpenSSL binding: plugins/tls_stubs.c
  // compiled and linked with `-custom -cclib -lssl -cclib -lcrypto`. The
  // template Makefile `-include`s the fragment and every variable it sets
  // is empty without it, so an SDK without secrets - or with the built-in
  // chain alone, or with `secretspec` alone - runs no C compiler and links
  // no OpenSSL. The shape lua's native.mk and c's kinds.c take.

  // The vendored stub opens with the vendoring tool's three-line `(* *)`
  // provenance header (every file under tm/ocaml is stamped in ocaml's
