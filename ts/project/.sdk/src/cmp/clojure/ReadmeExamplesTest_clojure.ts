// Emit a documentation clojure-examples SYNTAX gate INTO the shared gentest run
// body (the clojure test runner drives a single sdk.gentest/run). For each doc
// that ships clojure examples — the repository ROOT README.md, the per-language
// README.md, and REFERENCE.md — every ```clojure fenced block is extracted and
// PARSED with read-string (all forms wrapped in a vector), catching a malformed
// documented example (an unbalanced paren, a bad token, an unclosed string).
//
// SCOPE NOTE: like the elixir gate, this stops at the syntax check rather than
// EXECUTING each block. Running a README fragment against the generated
// namespaces would need the SDK loaded and the narrative requires resolved for
// every block; the syntax gate is a real, useful guard that keeps documented
// examples parseable as the generator evolves. A doc that is absent at test
// time is skipped (passes), so the gate never hard-fails on a missing file.
//
// The emitted clojure builds the triple-backtick fence from (char 96) so this
// TS template literal needs no embedded backticks.
